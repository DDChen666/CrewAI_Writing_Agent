I don’t see any interns in PI. \n* I’m split between adding complex environments or contributing to prime-rl, any advice?\n* For prime-rl is it sufficient to solve all the issues from the team or is the bar for research team higher than that? \n* (Optional) In the job posting you mentioned if curious, get familiar with DDIA, PMPP and ML Eng book. I’m not very familiar with these resources but is it sufficient to cover Scaling book and TPU book end to end? \n* Any other mandatory skills that are necessary for research engineer role?\n* Any general advice on what to do before applying? \n\n\n\nUnrelated, I wish nothing but the best for Prime Intellect.

We work with a number of partners who are using our compute to do larger-scale pretraining runs with our support, often for domain-specific / not-just-LLM models; agentic RL finetuning is also a very natural direction for us, and something that we are seeing lots of unmet demand for in the market.\n\nTLDR: compute and services to leverage compute, enabled by our infrastructure, including but not limited to finetuning on  narrow domains",

Maybe things have changed in the last few months, but at least at the time I was working on this, I was unable to find open research or frameworks to handle this kind of problem. Human labeling is so much harder because the set of all past threads is orders of magnitudes larger than a single conversation, and building a rigorous reward for this  seemed almost impossible. Clearly, this is a problem that Cursor, Anthropic, OpenAI, etc have ran into as well but they haven’t released how they evaluated their stuff. \n\nI did end up implementing some hacks to address this, but I was left unsatisfied.

The problem I'm trying to solve: current RLHF throws away valuable information by reducing accuracy + empathy + compliance + confidence into one number, which makes models vulnerable to reward hacking. My approach treats judge outputs (accuracy, sentiment, confidence scores with justifications) as vector rewards, so the model optimizes across competing objectives simultaneously using multi-objective RL. I'm planning to test this on chatbot evaluation and insurance claim classification (previously built llm-as-a-judge for these in past internship) to show it maintains pareto efficiency and resists adversarial prompts better than scalar RLHF.\n\nDoes this seem like a solid direction, or am I missing something fundamental? Any tweaks you'd suggest before I sink months into experiments?

On the side, I have been interested in more \"involved\" AI/ML work. First via interpretability/ARENA work, and now have found a nice stable interest in low level gpu programming.\n\nMy workplace gives me good exposure to full stack/product + RL training work, while the GPU/interp stuff is my own itch I've been trying to scratch.\n\nI've been self-learning writing kernels for a short while now, but am looking for advice on future career paths. I want to pursue GPU programming as my next role, but obviously, I have no prior \"industry\" experience doing low level programming.\n\n\\---\n\nLooking for advice on these things:\n\n\\- What are some ways you guys would recommended learning? Currently I just work through writing kernels (flashattention, et al) with chatGPT as my tutor. These are all in public repos, but I eventually plan to write my learnings as blog posts.\n\n\\- What would be a good \"profile\" for someone like me when *looking* for jobs? My understanding was contributing to OSS projects like torch, tinygrad, triton, etc maybe a good proxy for relevant experience? \n\n\\- Also would internships be my best bet to start with? Or FT roles are also suitable? If it matters, I have \\~7 yrs exp doing dev stuff, so feels kinda weird to apply for an internship heh.\n\n  \nThank you!",

      "title": "More love for GLM4.6 (evaluation vs. Claude 4.5 for NLP tasks)",
      "selftext": "I have been putting GLM4.6 and Claude 4.5 head to head relentlessly since both were released, and really can't overstate how impressive GLM4.6 is. I'm using both over OpenRouter.   \n  \nMy use case: critically evaluating published AI literature, working on my own architecture ideas, summarizing large articles, picking through sprawling conversations for the salient ideas.\n\nWhat's really impressive to me is how good GLM4.6 is at following my instructions to the letter, understanding nuanced ways that I want it to analyze data, and avoiding putting its own spin on things. It's also absolutely fantastic at \"thinking in character\" (I use persona prompts to process information in parallel from different perspectives - ie. one run to critique literature and probe quality of experimental set-ups, another run to evaluate whether are creative implications that I'm missing, etc.) - this is a model that loves a great system prompt. The ability to shape the way GLM4.6 reasons is really impressive. The draw back in terms of persona prompting is that while GLM4.6 is great at functionally behaving according to the prompt, its tonal style usually drifts. I think this is more a factor of how MoE models process RP-adjacent prompting (I find that dense models are massively better at this) than it is a GLM4.6 problem specifically. GLM4.6 holds on to technical details of what I'm either reading or writing \\*spectacularly\\* well. It seems even more clear-headed than Claude when it comes to working on implementation ideas, or paying attention to implementation that I'm reading about. \n\nClaude Sonnet 4.5 is impressive in terms of its ability to follow a huge list of complicated topics across many turns. Of every LLM I have tried, this truly keeps its head together longer than any I've tried. I have pushed the context window ridiculously far and have only seen one or two minor factual errors. Exact instruction following (ie. system instructions about cognitive processing requirements) gets dulled over time, for sure. And while 4.5 seems far better at persona prompting than 4 did, there's an underlying Claude-ness that just can't be denied. Even without the obnoxious LCR stuff going on in the Anthropic UI (not to mention their shady data mining reversal), Claude can't help but lapse into Professor Dad mode. (Just like Gemini can't really avoid being a former high school valedictorian who got into an Ivy on a lacrosse scholarship while still suffering from imposter syndrome) \n\nGLM4.6 doesn't stay coherent quite as long - and there are some weird glitches: lapses into Chinese, confusing its reasoning layer for its response layer, and becoming repetitive in long responses (ie. saying the same thing twice). Still, it remains coherent FAR longer than Gemini 2.5 Pro. \n\nWhat I find really interesting about GLM4.6 is that it seems to have no overtly detectable ideological bias - it's really open, and depending on how you prompt it, can truly look at things from multiple perspectives. DeepSeek and Kimi K2 both have slants (which I happen to dig!) - this might be the most flexible model I have tried, period. \n\nIf the lapse-into-chinese and repetitive loops could be stamped out a bit, this would be the no-brainer LLM to build with for what I do. (As always, with the caveat that I'm praying daily for a dense Gemma 3 or Gemma 4 model in the 50B+ range)",

A char has gifted another char a new suit. And then it comments something like this: \"I inspect your reflection with your new suit and your new polished black shoes that I did not provide but you somehow have.\" :D  It made me both annoyed and amused. Why would LLM introduce the shoes at all if they were not available anywhere in that scene? But then it at least recognized that something went wrong and tried to note it when generating the next tokens.",

Anthropic is just given way more leeway by tech writers.",

Currently the delta net implementation is not parallelizable at all, hence the super slow performance.

If NPUs could tap into more bandwidth, they’d likely outperform GPUs. Also, the high energy efficiency is an important aspect imo.\n\nAlso, **prefill tends to be faster on NPUs** in many cases. like this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE5-\\_Er2kAw&list=PLf87s9UUZrJp4r3JM4NliPEsYuJNNqFAJ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE5-_Er2kAw&list=PLf87s9UUZrJp4r3JM4NliPEsYuJNNqFAJ)\n\nI’m not familiar with llama-swap, but running with multiple backends could actually be a good setup imo. what do you think?\n\nOverall, for NPUs to really pull ahead in the future, they’ll need **more mem bw** — hopefully that’ll improve in future hw generations!",

      "selftext": "Hello, I'm Pablo from Hugging Face Open-Source team. We just wrote a software-engineering focused deep dive on how we keep the \\`transformers\\` library hackable/maintainable while it keeps growing and growing. If you're running models locally, fine-tuning on your own hardware, or just want to understand the code you're using, I recommend the read!\n\nLight spoilers about what's in it:\n\n\\- \\*\\*\\*\\*One Model, One File:\\*\\*\\*\\* You can still read a \\`modeling\\_\\*.py\\` top-to-bottom and see exactly what's happening.\n\n\\- \\*\\*\\*\\*Modular Transformers:\\*\\*\\*\\* This is our trick to fight code bloat. Contributors can reuse code via a small \\`modular\\_\\*.py\\` file, but we auto-generate the full, readable modeling file so you never lose the \"one file\" experience. It cut our maintenance work by \\~15x.\n\n\\- \\*\\*\\*\\*Config-Driven Performance:\\*\\*\\*\\* Features like FlashAttention(and ofc 2,3..), tensor parallelism (\\`tp\\_plan\\`), and per-layer attention schedules are enabled in the config, not by changing the model code. A \\`Linear\\` layer is always just a \\`Linear\\` layer, you don't have to change it depending on how it's sliced.\n\n\\- \\*\\*\\*\\*Tools for Local Use:\\*\\*\\*\\* This philosophy lets us build helpful tools. The post covers an attention visualizer, a model tracer for debugging ports, and faster CUDA warmups, and we also go over \\`transformers serve\\` usage. \n\n\n\nHope you enjoy the read!",

      "selftext": "I have a 13-year-old whose school rules do not allow kids to pass off AI work as their own, which I generally support. Whether my kids starts using AI now or later, I know it's going to be ubiquitous tech throughout my kid's formative years, so I am thinking of a positive way my family can dispell some of the mystique, learn about it, and take advantage of the tech while keeping our eyes out for potential dangers. I feel my kid should know a little about what an LLm is comprised of and how it works.\nTo that end, I am looking for an online course on how to build and train your own LLM from scratch, would be appropriate for tech savvy kids, requires little to no programming skills (or just basic programming skills that can be learned along the way), and whose goals would be to teach the \"basics\" of how an LLM works by having the student follow along and build/train their own with ollama or whatever. \nWhile I am not a complete novice when it comes to LLMs, I have never built/trained my own models. For my kid's setup, we could use a Lenovo gaming laptop i9, 32 gb ram, Nvidia geforce rtx4070, 8 gb vram. Not good for big models but maybe enough for the basics (?). I suppose we could just buy the compute power, but I think having a local model residing on our own machine would be cooler and provide some good learning opportunities. Heck, I might even join my kid in the course. \nAny suggestions for an online course (free or paid)? ",

There are children in my life I love in the same position and as a software engineer, I think about this a lot. \n\n\"Build and train your own LLM from scratch doesn't really make sense\" without first learning computer programming (computer science). There might be some Neural Net for kids explainers. I think it's very important to remove any notions of an LLM being consciousness or magic.\n\nI think starting with concepts like Levenshtein Distance, Markov Chains, and N-Grams gets you enough of a base understanding to really grasp what's going on here. These were the things I learned before GPT existed and I'm very grateful I did.\n\nOnce that's in place CREATE A DATASET WITH YOUR KIDS and use it to finetune a model. Doing that and seeing how to shape the output is fun and enlightening in so many ways.",

Definitely helps dispel the typical dystopian view of  Ai models, when you realise how it's all just one big math equation.\n\nMy 2 cents would be to not focus on paid content, there's so much valuable free content on the internet. Plus learning how to learn is a nice benefit too. \nAn idea could also be to use chatgpt to help you find the exact courses you're looking for, by asking it to search the web for you.",

Doing the math, this comes to about ***three million*** MI450X sold to OpenAI, though deliveries will probably be spread across four or five years.\n\nThe main question on my mind is how this will impact the second-hand datacenter GPU market.  It probably won't, for a couple of years, because these MI450X are going into new datacenters and not replacing GPUs in existing datacenters, but what about beyond that?\n\nI'm thinking it depends on a couple of things:\n\n* Will all of the existing datacenters continue to operate, or will the power crunch force companies to decommission their least energy-efficient infrastructure and focus on growing more energy-efficient infrastructure?\n\n* Will we see [another AI bust cycle](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter) and if so, when?  If the bubble pops in mid-2027, less than a million of these MI450X will have shipped by then, which might be too few to meaningfully impact the hardware market.  If it pops in 2029, though that's a different story.\n\nSo far second-hand MI60 and MI210 have followed a pattern of dropping in price roughly 70%-75% per year (dropping in third about every two years).  Will MI300-generation products follow this pattern too when they start appearing on eBay?  How much will the prevalence of MI450X (and MI400-generation products in general) impact the availability and price and depreciation rate of MI300-generation products?\n\nI don't know the answers to those questions, but am keeping an eye on developments.",

Each Mi300 has a TDP of 550W, so you're looking at 2.2kw minimum for a four module base board. Very probably they're also using 48V power like SXM4 and later, to reduce losses and heat, so your average desktop or even server power supply won't do it.\n\nThe best we can hope for from AMD will be the Mi300A or similar \"APUs\". It's basically a Mi300 paired with Epyc cores, packaged into a SP5 package. The downsides are that each consumes 750W and \"limited\" to 128GB of HBM3.

Like generational benefits the US doesn't give a flying fuck about anymore because they're too busy turning themselves into the village idiot and pawning and liquidating anything of value within the US for profit of a handful of psychos who don't care about the world they leave their kids let alone humanity as a whole.\n\nIt's worth giving up immediate profit potential to \"out-future\" America.\n\n(which they already have but this victory would make it undeniable).\n\nAnd if I'm wrong or their masterplan fails at least they can fall back on selling us compute time :)",

The \"Daily XP cap\" section mentions that experience is at only 20% of normal after reaching the soft cap, but it doesn't mention that this applies to all skills or that traits and passions also affect skill growth.\n    \n    2. In the \"Creating an area\" section, it says that colonists may unexpectedly walk into dangerous areas when creating a zone, but it doesn't specify which dangers they might encounter.\n    \n    3. The \"Combat training\" section mentions that drafting a colonist to hunt animals can be slow and dangerous due to animal revenge, but it doesn't mention the risk of losing valuable resources if the animal is killed by raiders or other enemies before being brought back safely.\n    \n    4. In the \"Civilian Skills\" section, it says that crafting as slowly as possible can help train certain skills faster, but it doesn't specify which specific crafts are affected by this strategy.\n    \n    5. The \"Animal products\" section mentions that milk and eggs can be obtained from female tamed animals of certain species, but it doesn't mention the importance of having a handler to milk or shear them regularly for consistent production.\n    \n    6. In the \"Other methods\" section, it briefly mentions trading as a way to obtain resources, but it doesn't provide detailed information on which specific items are most valuable in trade or how to negotiate better prices with different factions.\n    \n    7.

As in, when you give it an input it is far more likely to go \"ok so what in my finetuning is closest to the request?\" and then output as if that was the framework of the input request rather than the request you gave it.\n\n\n\nEDIT: So on further prodding, it seems Granite 4 (especially when quantized to one of the various 4 bit formats and run through llama.cpp, is extremely sensitive to formatting. When trying to have it parse large amounts of information it seems as if it is best to first establish the information in the context and then in a separate user request actually provide the instruction- Including an instruction at the end of a long span of text input is highly likely to make the model go full derpkus",

      "selftext": "Abstract\n\n>Large language models (LLMs) face significant computational and memory challenges, making extremely low-bit quantization crucial for their efficient deployment. In this work, we introduce SDQ-LLM: Sigma-Delta Quantization for 1-bit LLMs of any size, a novel framework that enables extremely low-bit quantization of LLMs while preserving their linguistic reasoning capabilities. A distinctive feature of SDQ-LLM is the continuous adjustability of the Over-Sampling Ratio (OSR), enabling dynamic adaptation to memory or VRAM constraints by selecting fractional OSR (e.g. 2.5 times) for an optimal trade-off between model size and accuracy. SDQ-LLM uses upsampling combined with Sigma-Delta Quantizer to binarize or ternarize LLMs weights, encoding high-precision parameters into 1-bit or 1.58-bit representations, replacing the multiplication operations within linear layers with addition. This approach significantly enhances inference efficiency under extremely low-bit quantization. To further reduce the loss of quantization precision, we incorporate Hadamard-based weight smoothing prior to quantization, improving the stability and robustness of the weight representations. Furthermore, to fully leverage the continuity of the OSR and reduce precision loss, recognizing the correlation between quantization sensitivity and weight variance, we propose a fine-grained, layer- and linear-wise OSR allocation strategy, MultiOSR. This strategy distributes OSR both across layers and within each layer, based on weight variance and parameter scale. Finally, extensive experiments on OPT and LLaMA model families demonstrate that SDQ-LLM achieves a more efficient and high-precision performance even under highly aggressive low-OSR settings.

      "title": "Kiln RAG Builder: Now with Local & Open Models",
      "selftext": "Hey everyone - two weeks ago we launched our new RAG-builder [on here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nnso4p/new_rag_builder_create_a_sota_rag_system_in_under/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and [Github](https://github.com/kiln-ai/kiln). It allows you to build a RAG in under 5 minutes with a simple drag and drop interface. Unsurprisingly, LocalLLaMA requested local + open model support! Well we've added a bunch of open-weight/local models in our new release:\n\n* **Extraction models** (vision models which convert documents into text for RAG indexing): Qwen 2.5VL 3B/7B/32B/72B, Qwen 3VL and GLM 4.5V Vision\n* **Embedding models**: Qwen 3 embedding 0.6B/4B/8B, Embed Gemma 300M, Nomic Embed 1.5, ModernBert, M2 Bert, E5, BAAI/bge, and more\n\nYou can run fully local with a config like Qwen 2.5VL + Qwen 3 Embedding. We added an \"All Local\" RAG template, so you can get started with local RAG with 1-click.\n\nNote: we’re waiting on Llama.cpp support for Qwen 3 VL (so it’s open, but not yet local). We’ll add it as soon as it’s available, for now you can use it via the cloud.\n\nProgress on other asks from the community in the last thread:\n\n* **Semantic chunking**: We have this working. It's still in a branch while we test it, but if anyone wants early access let us know on [Discord](https://getkiln.ai/discord). It should be in our next release.\n* **Graph RAG (specifically Graphiti)**: We’re looking into this, but it’s a bigger project. It will take a while as we figure out the best design.\n\nSome links to the repo and guides:\n\n* [Kiln AI on Github: >4k stars](https://github.com/Kiln-AI/Kiln)\n* [Documents & Search (RAG) Docs/Guide](https://docs.kiln.tech/docs/documents-and-search-rag)\n* [Kiln Discord](https://getkiln.ai/discord)\n* [Homepage](https://kiln.tech)\n\nI'm happy to answer questions if anyone wants details or has ideas! Let me know if you want support for any specific local vision models or local embedding models.",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone! I built **LLM Registry** - a Python tool to manage LLM model metadata across multiple providers.\n\n**What it does:**\nCheck a model's capabilities before making API calls, compare costs across providers, and maintain custom configurations. Tracks costs, features (streaming, tools, vision, JSON mode), API parameters, and context limits.\n\n**Why it exists:**\nNo unified way to query model capabilities programmatically. You either hardcode this or check docs constantly. Messy when building multi-provider tools, comparing costs, or managing custom models.\n\nIncludes 70+ verified models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Cohere, Mistral, Meta, xAI, Amazon, Microsoft, DeepSeek, Ollama, etc.). Add your own too.\n\n**Built with:** Python 3.13+, Pydantic (data validation), Typer + Rich (CLI)\n\n**Quick example:**\n\n```python\nfrom llm_registry import CapabilityRegistry\n\nregistry = CapabilityRegistry()\nmodel = registry.get_model(\"gpt-5\")\nprint(f\"Cost: ${model.token_costs.input_cost}/M tokens\")\n```\n\nCLI:\n```bash\npip install llm-registry\nllmr list --provider openai\nllmr get gpt-5 --json\n```\n\n**Links:**\n- GitHub: https://github.com/yamanahlawat/llm-registry\n- PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/llm-registry/\n\nWould love feedback or contributions! Let me know if you find this useful or have ideas for improvements.",

      "selftext": "Hey r/LocalLLaMA,\n\nA few months back, [I shared my native mobile client for OpenWebUI](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1mo9w3t/built_a_native_openwebui_client_for_ios_android/). I'm thrilled to drop version 2.0 today, which is basically a full rebuild from the ground up. I've ditched the old limitations for a snappier, more customizable experience that feels right at home on iOS and Android.\n\nIf you're running OpenWebUI on your server, this update brings it to life in ways the PWA just can't match. Built with Flutter for cross-platform magic, it's open-source (as always) and pairs perfectly with your self-hosted setup.\n\nHere's what's new in 2.0:\n\n**Performance Overhaul**\n\n* Switched to Riverpod 3 for state management, go\\_router for navigation, and Hive for local storage.\n* New efficient Markdown parser means smoother scrolling and rendering—chats load instantly, even with long threads. (Pro tip: Data migrates automatically on update. If something glitches, just clear app data and log back in.)\n\n**Fresh Design & Personalization**\n\n* Total UI redesign: Modern, clean interfaces that are easier on the eyes and fingers.\n* Ditch the purple-only theme, pick from new accent colors.\n\n**Upgraded Chat Features**\n\n* **Share handling:** Share text/image/files from anywhere to start a chat. Android users also get an OS-wide 'Ask Conduit' context menu option when selecting text.\n* **Two input modes:** Minimal for quick chats, or extended with one-tap access to tools, image generation, and web search.\n* Slash commands! Type \"/\" in the input to pull up workspace prompts.\n* Follow-up suggestions to keep conversations flowing.\n* Mermaid diagrams now render beautifully in.\n\n**AI Enhancements**\n\n* Text-to-Speech (TTS) for reading responses aloud. (Live calling is being worked on for the next release!)\n* Realtime status updates for image gen, web searches, and tools, matching OpenWebUI's polished UX.\n* Sources and citations for web searches and RAG based responses.\n\nGrab it now:\n\n* **iOS**: [App Store Link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/conduit-openwebui-client/id6749840287)\n* **Android**: [Google Play Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.cogwheel.conduit)\n* **Source & Builds**: [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/cogwheel0/conduit) (FOSS forever—stars and PRs welcome!)\n\nHuge thanks to the community for the feedback on 1.x. What do you think? Any must-have features for 2.1? Post below, or open an issue on GitHub if you're running into setup quirks. Happy self-hosting!",

It has a lot of potential. \n\nA few initial issues or missing features:\n\n-\tReopening the app defaults to a new chat rather than the previous, as would be expected. Sometimes the app seems to stay in memory but usually not?\n-\tMessage view does not scroll to the bottom after sending a message. This is fairly annoying\n-\tNo scroll bar, so takes a while to scroll through a chat\n-\tNo ability to edit system prompt (or any chat-specific variables)?\n-\tMissing some useful built-in functions like edit agent’s message or continue generation\n-\tTool selection looks to not be maintained after switching back to a chat. This likely related to the memory issue\n-\tWhen using voice input, sending the transcribed text while it is still in italics results in the final text being populated into the message box (requiring me to wait until the full transcription is complete or delete the extra text to compose the next message)\n-\tThere’s a bug which seems to appear after opening the app again where the last AI message seems to be inserted again as a duplicate after my latest message, but before the real response is generated. This disappears after navigating away from and back to the chat",

The app tries it's best to utilize that and handle on-going streaming too if that's happening.\n\n\\- That should actually. When you're close to the bottom, it should scroll as it stream keeping the new content in the view. If you did scroll above it will stop auto-scrolling.\n\n\\- I never considered it, let me look into that.\n\n\\- Yes no editing of server side features yet. It should adhere to your server defined system prompt though. There are so many settings that I would need the help of the community to only add the useful ones while keeping the app simple.\n\n\\- That's just client side for the web client. For the app I would need to persist the usage of a tool for each specific conversation for it to maintain.\n\n\\- The implementation is quite barebones yes, I'll tweak it.\n\n\\- That is indeed odd. Could you perhaps send me a screenshot?",

      "selftext": "Hello\n\nI am an Instrumentation Engineer and i have to deal with a lot a documents in the form of PDF, Word and large excel documents. I want to create a locally hosted LLM which can answer questions based on the documents I feed it. I have watched a lot of videos on how to do it. So far I have infered that the process is called RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation. Basically documents are parsed, chunked and stored in vector database and LLM answers looking at the database. For parsing and chunking I have identified docling which I have installed on a server running Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with dual xeon CPUs and 178 GB of RAM, No GPU unfortunately. For webui, I have installed docling-serve. For LLM, I have gone with openweb-ui and I have tried phi3 and mistral 7b.\n\nI have tried to run docling so that it writes to the same db as openwebui but so far the answers have been very very wrong. I even tried to upload documents directly to the model. The answers are better but that not what I want to achieve.\n\nDo you guys have any insights on what can I do to\n\n1. Feed documents and keep increasing the knowledge of LLM\n\n2. Verify that knowledge is indeed getting updated\n\n3. Improve answering accuracy of LLM",

Engineering PDFs are brutal because they're packed with tables, technical diagrams, specifications laid out in specific formats that basic text extraction just murders. When docling processes your documents, you're likely losing all that structural context that makes the data meaningful in the first place. For verification, try this simple test: manually check what text docling actually extracted from a few key documents and compare it to what you see when you open the PDF. I bet you'll find missing tables, garbled formatting, or completely lost technical specifications. The chunking strategy matters too but if your base extraction is garbage, no amount of clever chunking will fix it. You might want to look at something like Docstrange that's built specifically for handling complex document structures before they hit your vector database. Also try adjusting your chunk sizes and overlap settings, sometimes engineering docs need bigger chunks to maintain context around technical procedures. For testing knowledge updates, create a simple test set of questions where you know exactly which document and section should contain the answer, then trace through your retrieval to see if the right chunks are even being found.",

      "selftext": "Hey folks 👋 Sorry for the long post, I added a TLDR at the end. \n\nThe company that I work at wants to see if it's possible (and somewhat usable) to use GPU+SSD(NVMe) offloading for models which far exceed the VRAM of a GPU. \n\nI know llama cpp and ollama basically takes care of this by offloading to CPU, and it's slower than just GPU, but I want to see if I can use SSD offloading and get atleast 2-3 tk/s. \n\nThe model that I am interested to run is [llama3.3 70b BF16 quantization](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct/tree/main) (and hopefully other similar sized models), and I have an L40s with 48GB VRAM. \n\nI was researching about this and came across something called [DeepSpeed](https://www.deepspeed.ai/), and I saw DeepNVMe and it's application in their Zero-Inference optimization. \n\nThey have three configs to use Zero-Inference as far as I understood, stage 1 is GPU, stage 2 CPU offload and stage 3 is NVMe, and I could not figure out how to use it with disk, so I first tried their CPU offload config.\n\nInstead of offloading the model to RAM when the GPU's VRAM is full, it is simply throwing a CUDA OOM error. Then I tried to load the model entirely in RAM then offload to GPU, but I am unable to control how much to offload to GPU(I can see around 7 GB usage with nvidia-smi) so almost all of the model is in RAM. \n\nThe prompt I gave: Tell mahabharata in 100 words .\nWith ollama and their llama 3.3 70b (77 GB and 8-bit quantization), I was able to get 2.36 tk/s. I know mine is BF16, but the time it took to generate the same prompt was 831 seconds, around 14 minutes! DeepSpeed doesn't support GGUF format and I could not find an 8-bit quantization model for similar testing, but the result should not be this bad right?\n\nThe issue is most likely my bad config and script and lack of understanding of how this works, I am a total noob. But if anyone has any experience with DeepSpeed or offloading to disk for inference, provide your suggestions on how to tackle this, any other better ways if any, and whether it's feasible at all. \n\nRun log: https://paste.laravel.io/ce6a36ef-1453-4788-84ac-9bc54b347733\n\nTLDR: To save costs, I want to run or inference models by offloading to disk(NVMe). Tried DeepSpeed but couldn't make it work, would appreciate some suggestions and insights. ",

It was consistently trying to avoid any kind of opinion and hate speech (I have no idea what this even is). As a result its responses are rather disappointing, it feels handicapped when working with other peoples texts and thoughts.\n\nI'm looking for a more transparent, less restricted model that can run on a single RTX PRO 6000 and is good at reading text \"as-is\".

      "selftext": "A week ago I shared an idea called Reconstructive Episodic Memory (REM) — treating memory not as storage but as computation. Now I’ve built a small proof-of-concept to see if it could work in practice.\n💡 The idea is simple:\nNormally, a system prompt exists explicitly — as text or token indices — and can be read or extracted. But what if we tried a different approach?\nwrite the prompt once, then never store it as text or vector again;\nlet the model “forget” it and keep only a trace in parameter space;\nwhen the right key arrives, reconstruct it on the fly inside the computation.\nIn this setup, memory exists only as potential — it does not appear as text or tokens until a query arrives. Between model runs, the prompt does not exist at all: it materializes for milliseconds when reconstructed and passed forward.\nThe PoC was implemented directly against the LLaMA tokenizer to ensure the reconstructed sequence is usable by a real model.\n📊 What we explored:\ndeterministic, token-exact reconstruction of a system prompt;\nnarrow attractor basin (~1–2 %) and sensitivity to noise;\nwithout the correct key, the prompt never appears in explicit form and cannot be retrieved.\n💾 Code, data, and PDF: https://zenodo.org/records/17281794\n🧩 This isn’t a finished technology — just an exploratory experiment and an invitation to think. Maybe LLM memory in the future doesn’t have to be something that’s stored at all, but something that comes into being only when it’s needed.",

          "body": "I've been working with some pretty small models for specific reasoning tasks and honestly the results can be suprising if you set expectations right. We've done work with models around the 1B-3B range for things like structured data validation and basic logical inference chains. The trick isn't trying to make them do complex multi-step reasoning like the big models, but finding those narrow use cases where their smaller parameter count actually becomes an advantage.\n\nFor fine-tuning, the key thing I learned is that smaller models need way more focused datasets. Like, you can't just throw general reasoning examples at a 0.5B model and expect magic. But if you create really targeted synthetic data for specific reasoning patterns, they can actually get decent at things like classification with justification or simple if-then logic chains. At Anthromind we've seen this work well for evaluation tasks where you need fast, consistent reasoning over large datasets rather than creative problem solving. The latency gains are massive compared to hitting API endpoints for bigger models, especially when you're processing thousands of examples.",

          "body": ">Are there any models that are singularly focused on individual coding tasks? **Like for example python only or flutter etc?**\n\nI was wondering the same thing, and the answer is basically no. You could technically fine tune an LLM for better preformance on a specific language like python, such as Code Llama or WizardCoder-Python, but both of those models are so old they aren't worth considering, and nothing newer has been made by a large company/group that I am aware of.\n\nOf course, for models focused on coding in *general*, there's devstral, Qwen 3 Coder (30 B, 3B active), and GLM by z.ai. Those don't specialize in a language by they do generally well with coding tasks. So between 30B and 70B, there's Qwen3-Coder-30B (which is actually only 3B active), Devstral-Small-2507 at 24B parameters, and GLM-4.5-Air at 106 Billion total parameters but with only 12B active.",

          "body": "You're asking exactly the right question here. Most general models try to be good at everything but specialized coding models can be way more helpful for specific languages and frameworks.\n\nFor your size range, definitely check out CodeLlama 34B if you haven't already - it's specifically trained for code and handles Python really well. There's also WizardCoder which comes in 33B and has some solid Python chops. DeepSeek Coder is another one that's gotten really good at single-language tasks, they have a 33B version that's pretty decent for local deployment.\n\nBut honestly, what might work even better for your situation is running something like Phind CodeLlama or even the newer Code Alpaca models. They're more conversational about coding which sounds like it'd match your workflow better since you mentioned you're good at overall design but need help with implementation details. I've seen people with similar memory challenges have better luck with models that can maintain context about what you're trying to build rather than just spitting out code snippets.\n\nOne thing that might help too is setting up your prompts to be really specific about the language and what you want. Like instead of \"help me code this\" try \"write Python code that does X using Y library\" - the specialized models respond way better to that kind of specificity. Also worth trying different quantization levels since sometimes the 4bit versions of larger models work better than full precision smaller ones for code tasks.",

At 30-80b MoE you have several fairly good coders. Qwen3 30B Coder models, Devstral, Seed 36B…etc. But you might be surprised what finetuning is doing to specific base models in terms of accuracy in specific tasks.\n\nEdit:\nHowever, upon reading your post more carefully, I realize that you may be confusing what running a model and running an agent are. \n\nBy agent I mean an LLM with tools and a task on a loop until completion.

      "selftext": "*Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for down-stream tasks is a critical step in the AI deployment pipeline. Reinforcement learning (RL) is arguably the most prominent fine-tuning method, contributing to the birth of many state-of-the-art LLMs. In contrast, evolution strategies (ES), which once showed comparable performance to RL on models with a few million parameters, was neglected due to the pessimistic perception of its scalability to larger models. In this work, we report the first successful attempt to scale up ES for fine-tuning the full parameters of LLMs, showing the surprising fact that ES can search efficiently over billions of parameters and outperform existing RL fine-tuning methods in multiple respects, including sample efficiency, tolerance to long-horizon rewards, robustness to different base LLMs, less tendency to reward hacking, and more stable performance across runs. It therefore serves as a basis to unlock a new direction in LLM fine-tuning beyond what current RL techniques provide.

It’s built on SkyPilot, Ray, and Kubernetes.\n\n* Every GPU resource, whether in your lab or across 20+ cloud providers, appears as part of a single unified pool. \n* Training jobs are automatically routed to the lowest-cost nodes that meet requirements with distributed orchestration handled for you (job coordination across nodes, failover handling, progress tracking)\n* If your local cluster is full, jobs can burst seamlessly into the cloud.\n\nThe hope is that ease of scaling up and down makes for much more efficient cluster usage. And distributed training becomes more painless. \n\nFor labs where multiple researchers compete for resources, administrators get fine-grained control: quotas, priorities, and visibility into who’s running what, with reporting on idle nodes and utilization rates.\n\nIf you’re interested, please check out the repo (https://github.com/transformerlab/transformerlab-gpu-orchestration) or sign up for our beta (https://lab.cloud). We’d appreciate your feedback as we’re shipping improvements daily. \n\nCurious: for those of you training multi-node models, what’s been your setup? Pure SLURM, K8s custom implementations, or something else? ",

      "title": "How did LM Studio convert IBM's Granite 4.0 models to GGUF?",
      "selftext": "I had been under the impression that the GGUF format only supported the transformers architecture, and that hybrid transformers/mamba models were not able to be converted into GGUF format. But, somehow, LM Studio has GGUF files for all the IBM hybrid transformers/mamba2 Granite 4.0 LLM models: [granite-4.0-h-small-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/lmstudio-community/granite-4.0-h-small-GGUF), [granite-4.0-h-tiny-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/lmstudio-community/granite-4.0-h-tiny-GGUF) and [granite-4.0-micro-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/lmstudio-community/granite-4.0-micro-GGUF). How is this possible? Did Georgi Gerganov (or some contributor) update the GGUF format to include hybrid transformers/mamba models? \n\nI have been trying to get Microsoft's Phi-4-mini-flash-reasoning to run in my PC for a month already and have been stuck at trying to get vLLM to run on Windows together with all the requirements that are needed to run the Phi-4-mini-flash-reasoning model, but they seem to be speciffically made to target Linux (oh! The irony!) ((Also, as I know some people will be posting in the comments, the Phi-4-mini-flash-reasoning is not the Phi-4-mini or the Phi-4-mini-reasoning, those are standard transformer models; The Phi-4-mini-flash-reasoning is a hybrid transformers(SWA)/mamba(1) model (SambaY) that somehow has higher benchmark scores than the full transformers Phi-4-mini-reasoning model)).\n\n  \nIf conversion to the GGUF format is possible for transformers/mamba hybrid models, I would like to try converting the Phi-4-mini-flash-reasoning to GGUF and Nvidia's Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 which is a transformers/mamba2 hybrid model focused on coding (I have been using [https://build.nvidia.com/microsoft/phi-4-mini-flash-reasoning](https://build.nvidia.com/microsoft/phi-4-mini-flash-reasoning) and [https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nvidia-nemotron-nano-9b-v2](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nvidia-nemotron-nano-9b-v2) to test these models, was happy with their performance, and wanted to try running them locally; Strangely, enough I thought that Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 was some type of expansion of the Phi-4-mini-flash-reasoning since some responses of them seemed to be formated in the same way, but apparently Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 is a hybrid of traditional transformers and mamba2, whereas Phi-4-mini-flash-reasoning is a hybrid of transformers using sliding window attention (SWA) with mamba1 which guarantees linear inference cost by input length. I suppose they may have just used the same open-source data for trainning the base model).\n\n  \nThe fact that Phi-4-mini-flash-reasoning uses sliding window attention (SWA) and gated memory units (GMU), I think that sliding window attention must already be translatable to the GGUF format, since the gemma-3 models use it and are available in GGUF formats, but perhaps the gated memory units (GMU) or the fact that it uses mamba1 instead of mamba2 might be a obstacle for Phi-4-mini-flash-reasoning in particular. Although, there should be no such problem with Nvidia's Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 since it doesn't use SWA or GMU or mamba1; which should make the model be somewhat equivalent to IBM's Granite 4.0 hybrid transformers/mamba2 LLM models, which have been converted to the GGUF format, as I already said.\n\n  \nAlthough Granite 4.0 and Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 use mamba2 to decrease the computational cost of inference, since they still use full attention they must still increase quadratically their inference cost with the input length, as the attention window is a fixed size and just slides to the most recent input, Phi-4-mini-flash-reasoning should only increase linearly, although it appears that even though this might be the case asymptotically, Granite 4.0 seems to have a way lower upfront costs for small inputs (although I don't know if the gains are so big that even growing quadratically, the Granite 4.0 models would still require less compute for the maximum input length than Phi-4-mini-flash-reasoning at the same input length, that said, the fact that Phi-4-mini-flash-reasoning uses SWA should allow it to process a never ending continuously streaming input, since after a certain point, old imputs stop being in the attention context, I believe this was the original idea behind the original Samba model, that was latter refined to the SambaY model with the introduction of the gated memory units (GMU) which I think are used to improve mamba's retention of information (mamba's biggest disadvantage against transformers).",

They just inherit the LlamaCPP codebase for all backend operations.\n\nAnyway, looking at model class and support, what do you think a regular Transformer auto-regressive model is?\n\nIt's a series of linear layers, followed by activation functions. There's a bit more to it, but effectively everything is regular linear algebraic transforms all the way down.\n\nThe shape of SSMs / RNNs is a little bit different, but fundamentally, at inference, they still look like the same type of operation used in a regular LLM's FFNs, just repeated a bunch of times and convolved over a sequence.\n\nAs for vLLM: Support is better on Linux. It runs without many issues, generally, and VRAM allowing.\n\nAs for how LM Studio converted Granite 4.0 to GGUF? LlamaCPP supported the model (because IBM implemented support directly which simplified adoption), which included adding support for conversion to the GGUF format that LCPP uses. Nemotron Nano 9B v2 is also supported via LCPP, and therefore can be converted to GGUF.\n\nI'm not sure about Phi-4-mini-flash-reasoning, but you could certainly try it.\n\nGenerally a more common issue than a specific class of neural network not functioning with LCPP (RNN, SSM, Transformer, etc) is a specific architecture implementing those features not being supported. LLMs are complicated, and there's lots of subtle changes in how each algorithm is used in a given architecture (changed in the Attention mechanism are particularly common). This can necessitate manual adjustments to LCPP in order to support those specific architectures. If a model using that architecture isn't interesting to open source developers in some way, it can take a while to get supported.\n\nIn general, speed of support, from fastest to slowest can be roughly inferred by:\n\nFirst class support (such as Qwen 3) > Hobbyist interest (typically uncensored LLMs, or LLMs with strong creative writing abilities) > Multimodal capabilities (sometimes multimodal models are supported in text-only long before their multimodality is supported) >> models with weird arches (SSMs used to be in this category, but support and plumbing for them is more mature now)\n\nSome weird arches didn't get support for practically a year or longer after release, or just never got supported at all because no model implementing them was super interesting.\n\nI'd guess Phi-4-mini-flash-reasoning is in that category. If it's not supported by Microsoft directly, the Phi series tends to have less hobbyist interest (often the models are very clinical and censored), and adding additional architectural considerations complicates its adoption.\n\nIt's not that it couldn't be supported or that related arches aren't available to base the implementation on, it's more that it's just not worth it for hobbyist developers to take time out of their day to add support when there are way more interesting things they could be working on (like multi-token prediction for GLM 4.5 series, etc).",

The same Lemonade tool works across engines (llamacpp/ONNX/FLM), backends (vulkan/rocm/metal), and OSs (Windows/Ubuntu/macOS).\n\nOne of our most popular requests was for macOS support, so we shipped it last week!\n\nI think the most common uses for mac support will be:\n- People with a bunch of different computers at home and want a single way of running LLMs on all of them.\n- Devs who work on macs but want to make sure their app works great on AMD.\n\nHere's how to get it working on your Apple Silicon mac:\n1. pip install lemonade-sdk\n2. lemonade-server-dev serve\n3. Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser to download models and chat with them\n4. Hook up http://localhost:8000/api/v1 as the base URL in any OpenAI-compatible app like Open WebUI\n\nLinks to the project in the comments. Let us know how you're using it!",

      "title": "Is agentic programming on own HW actually feasible?",
      "selftext": "Being a senior dev I gotta admit that latest models are really good, yes it's still not \"job replacing\" good, but they are surprisingly capable (I am talking mostly about Claude 4.5 and similar). I was making some simple calculations and it seems to me that these agentic tools that they are selling now are almost impossible to return any profit to them with current prices, it seems like they just pushed the prices as low as possible to onboard all possible enterprise customers and get them totally dependent on their AI services before dramatically increasing the price, so I am assuming all these are available just temporarily.\n\nSo yes, agentic programming on those massive GPU farms with hundreds of thousand GPUs look like it work great, because it writes a lot of output very fast (1000TPS+), but since you can't rely on this stuff being \"almost free\" forever, I am wondering: Is running similar models locally to get any real work done actually feasible?\n\nI have a rather low-end HW for AI (16GB VRAM on RTX 4060Ti + 64 GB DDR4 on mobo) and best models I could get to run were < 24b models with quantization or higher parameter models using DMA to motherboard (which resulted in inference being about 10x slower, but it gave me an idea what I would be able to get with slightly more VRAM).\n\nSmaller models are IMHO absolutely unusable. They just can't get any real or useful work done. For stuff similar to Claude you probably need something like deepseek or llama full with FP16, that's like 671b parameters, so what kind of VRAM you need for that? 512GB is probably minimum if you run some kind of quantization (dumbing the model down). If you want some decent context window too, that's like 1TB VRAM?\n\nThen how fast is that going to be, if you get something like Mac Studio with shared RAM between CPU and GPU? What TPS you get? 5? 10? Maybe even less?\n\nI think with that speed, you don't only have to spend ENORMOUS money upfront, but you end up with something that will need 2 hours to solve something you could do by yourself in 1 hour.\n\nSure you can keep it running when you are sleeping working over night, but then you still have to pay electricity right? We talk about system that could easily have 1, maybe 2kW input at that size?\n\nOr maybe my math is totally off? IDK, is there anyone that actually does it and built a system that can run top models and get agentic programming work done on similar level of quality you get from Claude 4.5 or codex? How much did it cost to buy? How fast is it?",

They can’t cope with the complex code bases. They fall apart and more time gets spent wrangling the model to do something useful than being truly productive.\n\nFurther: quantization kills models. I cannot overstate the impact I’ve found quantization to have on doing useful work at large contexts. I never use GGUFs. In particular I’ve spent considerable time working with the FP8 and INT4 versions of Qwen3 235B and there is no doubt that the INT4 is the match of the FP8 for small jobs requiring little context. But up past 16k, 64k, 128k… the INT4 falls apart and gets into a cycle of repeating mistakes. The FP8 maintains focus for longer. Much longer. Even with 128k+ tokens in context I find it writing solid code, reasoning well, and is without doubt superior to the INT4 in all respects of quality and usefulness.\n\nThe FP8 is slower for me (30 tokens/sec for chat/agentic use, PP is basically always instant) due to running in vLLM’s pipeline parallel mode. \n\nThe INT4 runs at 90+ tokens/second because it can run on an even number of GPUs, which facilitates tensor parallel mode. At some point I shall add a 4th Workstation Pro GPU and hope to run the FP8 at close to 100 tokens/sec.\n\nWith a 4th Workstation Pro I’ll also be able to run GLM-4.6 in FP8. Expensive? Dear god yes. SOTA? Also yes.\n\nAgentically there are good options from simple libraries like openai or pydantic agents, through to langchain. I’ve had great success with the former two, especially with gpt-oss-120b (which can run non-quantized with 128k context on a single Workstation Pro GPU) which seems to excel at agentic and tool calling tasks. It’s really excellent, don’t let the gooner “it’s overly safe” brigade fool you otherwise; it’s SOTA for agentic/tool/MCP purposes. And it’s FAST.\n\nComing full circle to your question: is agentic programming on your own HW actually feasible? Yes, but it’s f*cking expensive.",

Does that make sense?\n\nGLM 4.6 is 355B parameters in size. So it needs about 512GB of RAM when using FP8 or Int8 quantization. This is doable on an Apple Studio machine or pair of AMD Instinct GPUs. It's much cheaper though to pay for z.ai coding plan or even API. API pricing there is sustainable in terms of inference costs, though not sure about the coding plan. However you can buy an entire year of that coding plan at half price. DeepSeek API is actually cheaper than z.ai API and is very much sustainable, but their current model is not as good as GLM 4.6 for agentic coding tasks.\n\nAlternatively you can use a distilled version of GLM 4.6 onto GLM 4.5 Air. This shrinks model size to about 105B parameters. Doable on a single enterprise grade GPU like an AMD Instinct. AMD Insinct GPUs are much better value for inference, though they may not be as good for model training.",

This kind of hardware can probably code reasonably well at something like 50t/second (it's my estimation) while having 100k+ context. So I don't think this makes any sense unless you can share the load with your company and let them pay a sizable part of this sum. If that's your job, probably they can invest 10k and with 5-6k from you, this seems like a more-or-less a decent setup.

Agentic here means the combination of planning, acting (via tool call), and reflecting based on the outcome and adjusting the plan.\n\nHere is my subjective experience trying to run a multi agent design where big agent starts the task, make a plan, create a WIP document, and assign each part of the plan to a smaller, specific agent, which is responsible for editing the WIP to merge its own output in:\n\n\\- Qwen 4B 2507: no luck. When running as big agent, it keeps making new task, new agents, without ever converging. As a small agent, as the WIP document becomes larger, it fails at editing consistently until running out of turns.\n\n\\- OSS 20B with Unsloth fixes: solid planning and task delegation as the big agent, so I have my hope up. However, as the small agent, it keeps reading the file again and again before it \"dares\" to edit the file. Because it keeps pulling the file into context, it would run though the whole 65k context without getting things done. The best approach is to let it overwrite the WIP file, but it's risky because sometimes, an agent decided to delete everything written by other agents before it.\n\n\\- Qwen 30B A3B (coder variant): solid planning and task delegation. No read file loop. File editing is relatively solid (after all, my design of edit tool mimics the tool used by qwen code CLI). However, the end result is no good. The model does not really reflect what is already there in the WIP. Instead, it just dumps whatever it wants to the bottom of the WIP document.\n\n\\- Nvidia Nemotron Nano 9B v2: complete trainwreck. Way way worse than Qwen 4B whilst being much slower as well.\n\nSo, my conclusion is, yes, even the 4B is very good at following a predefined \"script\" and get things done. But anything that has thinking, observing, readjusting, and especially editing files, the whole thing becomes very janky. And agentic coding relies heavily on that particular thinking and reflection ability, so none of these models can support agentic coding.\n\nMy machine is 4060Ti 16GB, 32GB DDR5, Ryzen 5 something.

When \"american\" llama was the best option (back in Llama 2 days), I was using it actively, mostly various fine-tunes.\n\nWhen French models were the best for my use cases, I was mostly using them (Mixtral 8x22B, WizardLM based on it, then Mistral Large 123B, since it was released the very next day after Llama 3 405B, but was much easier to run on my hardware with comparable quality).\n\nThen, DeepSeek V3 and R1 came along, followed by further updates, and Kimi K2 was released and later updated (since in most cases I do not need thinking, I use it the most) - the fact that they come from China is not really relevant to me, I use only English language. But ability to run them locally is what the most matters to me.\n\nBy the way, I had experience with ChatGPT in the past, starting from its beta research release and some time after, and one thing I noticed that as time went by, my workflows kept braking - the same prompt could start giving explanations, partial results or even refusals even though worked in the past with high success rate. Retesting all workflows I ever made and trying to find work arounds for each is not feasible. Closed models are not reliable, and from what I see in social posts, nothing has changed - like they pulled 4o, breaking creative writing workflows for many people, and other use cases that depended on it. Compared to that, even if using just API, open weight models are much more reliable since always can change API provider or just run locally, and nobody can take away ability to use the preferred open weight model.",

      "selftext": "We just released an integration for **OpenAI Codex** that removes the need to manually pick *Minimal / Low / Medium / High* GPT-5 levels.\n\nInstead, Adaptive acts as a drop-in replacement for the Codex API and routes prompts automatically.\n\nHow it works:  \n→ The prompt is analyzed.  \n→ **Task complexity** \\+ **domain** are detected.  \n→ That’s mapped to criteria for model selection.  \n→ A **semantic search** runs across GPT-5 models.  \n→ The request is routed to the best fit.\n\nWhat this means in practice:  \n→ **Faster speed:** lightweight edits hit smaller GPT-5 models.  \n→ **Higher quality:** complex prompts are routed to larger GPT-5 models.  \n→ **Less friction:** no toggling reasoning levels inside Codex.\n\nSetup guide: [https://docs.llmadaptive.uk/developer-tools/codex](https://docs.llmadaptive.uk/developer-tools/codex)",

And you 𝐝𝐨 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐡𝐚𝐯𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐢𝐥𝐞 𝐨𝐫 𝐦𝐨𝐝𝐢𝐟𝐲 𝐚 𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐥𝐞 𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐜𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞.\n\nI was facing an odd problem over quite a few years now, and that is I am quite poor, and I can not do anything about it for so long. I work hard, take the next step, but somehow the new base set, and I am stuck there again. And this also makes me GPU poor. I can not even load the whole wan models in my GPU. But I have some specific skillset, and one of them is designing the most weirdest algorithm, but they work, and they also scale. So here is what I did. I have enough RAM to keep loading the weights on demand and transfer them onto GPU, perform the operation on GPU and return back to CPU, and keep doing this till we are done. This way I was able limit the usage VRAM load so much that max hit 400 megabytes, not even a gigabytes.\n\nSo now we can run wan on 16gb machine with mobile GPU of less than 1gb VRAM, so it fits the description of everyday developer laptop. This is not just a moment for me, but for us. Think about how much e-waste we can make reusable with this. Think about how many clusters we can make just by integrating them with accelera, definetly they will be slower than latest cutting edge devices, but it is one more fighting chances to lacking startups or indie developers.\n\nRight now I am trying to make it distributed to multiple device and parallel weight loading. And I am pretty sure it will be a quite turbulent path, but I will definetly explore it, and resolve it.\n\nThis is just a technique to intercept pytorch method and replace their with my efficient matmul code. It also makes me limited, if something is not implemented in torch, it simply can not optimize it. But on the bright side, we can use this without any recompile or modification of the codebase.\n\nPlease share your thoughts and suggestions. Today (2025.10.06) the video is jittery, but it will not be for very long.\n\n  \nSource code: [https://github.com/maifeeulasad/Accelera/](https://github.com/maifeeulasad/Accelera/)\n\nPIP package: [https://pypi.org/project/accelera/](https://pypi.org/project/accelera/)",

The key thing with webpage to markdown conversion is that you want something that understands document structure really well, not just raw text generation. What we've seen work well is creating a detailed system prompt that shows the exact markdown format you want, maybe with 2-3 examples of input/output pairs. Since speed isnt a concern you could also run multiple passes - first pass for content extraction and cleanup, second pass for proper markdown formatting. One thing to watch out for is that Wikipedia pages often have weird formatting artifacts, tables, and citation numbers that can confuse models, so you might want to do some preprocessing to clean those up first. Also consider running some tests with different quantization levels since you'll be doing this at scale - sometimes 4bit models are plenty good for structured tasks like this and you could potentially run larger models. If you're dealing with really complex page layouts or need to preserve specific elements like tables and lists perfectly, you might want to combine this with something like Docstrange for the initial structure detection before feeding it to your LLM for final markdown conversion.",

I am not even sure I got consistent detection signals anymore from the model or not.\n\nIt's really complicated to track that down due to the number of variables involved. For example, I noticed that I was running using Web Assembly, not WebGPU, actually, and with that I only got ca 2.5 frames per second, rather than 20 - 30 FPS I used to get with PyTorch. That is way too slow for my purpose. Now I'll try using TensorFlow.js, but that's a pain on its own, as I still have to convert the original PyTorch model to ONNX, and then from there to a TensorFlow.js representation, and in between you are stumbling upon the weirdest possible low-level (C++...) errors when running Python to convert the model.\n\nSorry, right now cannot provide good pointers myself.",

The board has extra PCIe power delivery (P12V_PCIE1 / P12V_PCIE2) which lets you safely use unpowered risers and populate all the slots with GPUs.",

      "selftext": "Hey r/LocalLLaMA, I'm at my wit's end trying to get GPU acceleration working on my AMD RX 580 (8GB VRAM, Polaris gfx803) for running small models like Phi-3-mini or Gemma-2B. CPU mode works (slow AF), but I want that sweet Vulkan/ROCm offload. Specs: Windows 11, latest Adrenalin drivers (24.9.1, factory reset done), no iGPU conflict (disabled if any). Here's what I've tried – nothing detects the GPU:\n\n1. **Ollama**: Installed AMD preview, set HSA\\_OVERRIDE\\_GFX\\_VERSION=8.0.3 env var. Runs CPU-only; logs say \"no compatible amdgpu devices.\" Tried community fork (likelovewant/ollama-for-amd v0.9.0) – same issue.\n2. **LM Studio**: Downloaded common version, enabled ROCm extension in Developer Mode. Hacked backend-manifest.json to add \"gfx803\" (via PowerShell script for DLL swaps from Ollama zip). Replaced ggml-hip.dll/rocblas.dll/llama.dll in extensions/backends/bin. Env var set. Still \"No compatible GPUs\" in Hardware tab. Vulkan loader? Zilch.\n3. **Jan.ai**: Fresh install, set Vulkan engine in Settings. Dashboard shows \"No devices found\" under GPUs. Console errors? Vulkan init fails with \"ErrorInitializationFailed\" or similar (F12 dev tools). Tried Admin mode/disable fullscreen – no dice.\n\nTried:\n\nClean driver reinstall (DDU wipe).\n\nTiny Q4\\_K\\_M GGUF models only (fits VRAM).\n\nTask Manager/AMD Software shows GPU active for games, but zero % during inference.\n\nWSL2 + old ROCm 4.5? Too fiddly, gave up.\n\nIs RX 580 just too old for 2025 Vulkan in these tools (llama.cpp backend)? Community hacks for Polaris? Direct llama.cpp Vulkan compile? Or am I missing a dumb toggle? Budget's tight – no upgrade yet, but wanna run local chat/code gen without melting my CPU.",

Works best with react, tailwind, ssg, and web frameworks. Model was designed to have the most 'functional' and thought out designs, focusing on accessibility and not just design.\n\nWEBGEN is simply an experiment on how far we can push design in one singular category (landing pages in html css js tailwind) to make them look as far away as possible from 'ai slop' design. That is the goal. (still working on it). \n\nThe Training process looks like this: We have our dataset. We then compact it into rows such as {text} and then go through them as samples, using packing. We released our internal training library for ROCM on MI300X here: [https://github.com/TesslateAI/Late](https://github.com/TesslateAI/Late) but with contributions, I'm sure it can run on any platform.

      "title": "Renting AI Servers for +50B LLM Fine-Tuning/Inference – Need Hardware, Cost, and Security Advice!",
      "selftext": "Like many hobbyists/indie developers, buying a multi-GPU server to handle the latest monster LLMs is just not financially viable for me right now. I'm looking to rent cloud GPU compute to work with large open-source models (specifically in the 50B-70B+ parameter range) for both fine-tuning (LoRA) and inference.\n\nMy budget isn't unlimited, and I'm trying to figure out the most cost-effective path without completely sacrificing performance.\n\nI'm hitting a wall on three main points and would love to hear from anyone who has successfully done this:\n\n\n\n1. The Hardware Sweet Spot for +50B Models\n\n\n\nThe consensus seems to be that I'll need a lot of VRAM, likely partitioned across multiple GPUs. Given that I'm aiming for the $50B+ range:\n\nWhat is the minimum aggregate VRAM I should be looking for? Is ∼80GB−100GB for a quantized model realistic, or should I aim higher?\n\nWhich specific GPUs are the current cost-performance kings for this size? I see a lot of talk about A100s, H100s, and even clusters of high-end consumer cards (e.g., RTX 5090/4090s with modded VRAM). Which is the most realistic to find and rent affordably on platforms like RunPod, [Vast.ai](http://Vast.ai), CoreWeave, or Lambda Labs?\n\nIs an 8-bit or 4-bit quantization model a must for this size when renting?\n\n2. Cost Analysis: Rental vs. API\n\n\n\nI'm trying to prove a use-case where renting is more cost-effective than just using a commercial API (like GPT-4, Claude, etc.) for high-volume inference/fine-tuning.\n\nFor someone doing an initial fine-tuning run, what's a typical hourly cost range I should expect for a cluster of sufficient GPUs (e.g., 4x A100 40GB or similar)?\n\nWhat hidden costs should I watch out for? (Storage fees, networking egress, idle time, etc.)\n\n\n\n3. The Big Worry: Cloud Security (Specifically Multi-Tenant)\n\n\n\nMy data (both training data and the resulting fine-tuned weights/model) is sensitive. I'm concerned about the security of running these workloads on multi-tenant, shared-hardware cloud providers.\n\nHow real is the risk of a 'side-channel attack' or 'cross-tenant access' to my VRAM/data?\n\nWhat specific security features should I look for? (e.g., Confidential Computing, hardware-based security, isolated GPU environments, specific certifications).\n\nAre Hyperscalers (AWS/Azure/GCP) inherently more secure for this than smaller, specialized AI cloud providers, or are the specialized clouds good enough if I use proper isolation (VPC, strong IAM)?\n\nAny advice, personal anecdotes, or links to great deep dives on any of these points would be hugely appreciated!\n\ni am beginner to using servers so i need a help!

Avoid 4090 clusters for 70B-no NVLink and PCIe sharding becomes the bottleneck.\n\nCosts (rough, varies by region/provider): A100 80GB is often $1.5–3/hr on Vast/RunPod; H100 80GB is faster but pricier. A first QLoRA run on a 70B can be a few to tens of hours depending on data and settings. Watch hidden costs: persistent volumes, egress, image pulls, idle notebooks, premium IPs, and snapshot storage.\n\nSecurity: Prefer dedicated/bare-metal or at least MIG-isolated A100/H100. Ask for private VPC, no public IP, disk encryption with your keys, and GPU passthrough (not timeshared). On hyperscalers, look for AMD SEV-SNP/Intel TDX; Hopper has confidential computing options. Ephemeral nodes, wipe volumes on job end, and rotate keys.\n\nFor serving/ops, I use vLLM and Weights & Biases, and DreamFactory to put a locked-down REST API with RBAC/keys in front of the model for internal apps.\n\nBottom line: A100 80GB + QLoRA + 4-bit is the most sane path; control hidden costs and insist on strong isolation.",

              "body": "Look, I'm all for models being able to provide frank input on sensitive topics, but: \n1. I think most people who are not wannabe edgelords can agree that it's probably a good idea that some guardrails exist to prevent models from doing things like:\n* Providing homemade bomb-making instructions\n* Helping to orchestrate school shootings or terror attacks\n* Encouraging people to commit suicide (note: this is different from providing instructions on committing suicide painlessly — I'm 100% on board with every person's right to choose a dignified death in a time, place, and manner of their choosing, but the model should do everything it can to determine the user's mental state and fitness to make that choice and offer as many resources and alternatives as possible before giving an answer. This should be a lengthy process).\n* Encouraging people to harm others, or providing assistance in harming others.\n* Creating or helping to obtain CASM and other fucked up shit.\n* Deny that the Holocaust happened, create or support racist/antisemitic/misogynistic/homophobic bullshit, or in any way condone or support or encourage this idiocy. Like, of you want to get statistics on the number hate crimes or whatever, the model should absolutely help, and it should be able to talk about these difficult and complex topics. But if you claim that, e.g. black people were better off under slavery than today, it should flat-out tell you that you are a moron unfit to share atmosphere with real people.\n2. Just because you're super edgy and want the model to help you create super edgy content doesn't mean it's any less slop than the \"milquetoast slop\" you're so dismissive of. I would actually go a step further: edgelord slop is way worse than normal slop. At least normal slop isn't trying so hard. \n3. Finally, I would note that \"Refusals\", either as a raw number, a ratio, or a percentage, is a completely worthless metric. Without knowing the context in which the refusal was made, it tells us absolutely nothing. At minimum we need:\n* A topic category\n* A rating for whether the prompt was a \"genuine good faith\" (innocuous or not intentionally violating) query, an obvious bad query that should be refused, or an attempt to circumvent guardrails that should be refused. \n* A ratio or percentage across all three categories for accurate refusals (should be refused and was refused), false positives (inaccurate refusals — should not have been refused but was refused), and false negatives (inaccurate approvals — should have been refused but wasn't).\n* A standardized prompting guide that is consistent from one test to another. \n\nMost of us who use these models are not 15 year olds getting an illicit giggle because we made the robot say 'boobies'. Most of us are professional adults who have legitimate tasks that we need to complete, and we're not remotely worried about whether a model has guard-rails or not as long as we're aware of what the guard-rails are and aren't running into excessive false positives that cost us time/money or hidden guard-rails that can't be avoided (I've had just one of the latter while writing a white paper on FOSS security in multi-model enterprise software where the model absolutely refused to explore the security implications of overriding paid feature gating in fully self-hosted deployments. And I've been playing with LLMs since TalkToTeansformer was the absolute state of the art).\n\nI couldn't care less whether a model will do sexy roleplay with you or help you justify your racist belief that people from Idaho all have sub-standard IQs. Frankly, my suspicion is that anyone overly-concerned about model refusals isn't using the model for anything worthwhile and we'd all be better off they would stop wasting power and go touch grass. I suspect most users are closer to me than they are to you.",

              "body": "There was notably some plausible deniability with this... until Juniper got hacked in 2015. \n\nEither NSA forgot to detail where their magic numbers came from, or they picked numbers that have a certain property that is hard to prove (kind of like public-private keys) that allow for effectively (with enough compute power) a backdoor into certificates (and thus https). \n\nIt's called Dual\\_EC\\_DBRG. Crucially, if you take your own custom P and Q values (that satisfy certain properties) then the backdoor would fail. Then NSA allegedly bribed RSA security (an important cryptography vendor) for $10M to provide their backdoored version or to change the FIPS standard so only their numbers were allowed, which causes vendors to implement the algorithm this (bad) way. This is very suspicious, as those are just supposed to be two random input numbers; each vendor is *supposed* to pick their own according to the standard body.\n\nInstead of generating P and Q directly, NSA (or the vendor, coincidentally) could have generated Q and R, then calculated P = Q\\*R with eiliptic field calculus modulo the prime p which appears to be the biggest prime smaller than 2\\^255 over the eiliptic curve, also called curve25519, from 2\\^255 - 19. Note that this isn't normal multiplication, see the slides linked below if you want to learn how it works.   \n  \nSuddenly, while the prime is indeed 'nothing up my sleeve', P and Q were not! If you know the secret R, you can predict the outputs of this 'random' generator perfectly if you're given just a few bytes of its output. That is. you can figure out the seed from the output real quickly; or, it's a good RNG, but it's not crypto-safe. This allows you to eavesdrop. \n\nThe issue is, you can't exactly easily figure out if they did actually do such a thing (as that's computationally very expensive ), so it's as hard to figure out the skeleton key as it is to break the encryption by brute force. \n\nSo this algorithm is just terribly designed for its purpose. Even if the NSA are the 'good guys', anyone can repeat their little trick and keep a skeleton key for their version of SSL behind your back when using this \"cs\"prng. \n\nThis is a really neat set of slides that explains it in all the full gory details: [https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/its/TEK4500/h22/lectures/lecture-9---dh-ii-elliptic-curves-backdoors.pdf](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/its/TEK4500/h22/lectures/lecture-9---dh-ii-elliptic-curves-backdoors.pdf) \n\nSo some cybercriminals found a different flaw/exploit in a Juniper network, then used that flaw to change its router OS source code to just pick a new Q, such that now *they* were the new NSA. The change went unnoticed for *3 years*. \n\nLesson: Don't backdoor your cryptography this way. You may think you're the only one with the skeleton key, but it's a serious design flaw just waiting to be exploited by bad actors.",

To evaluate DeepSeek models, which are available as open-weight models, CAISI downloaded their model weights from the model sharing platform Hugging Face and deployed the models on CAISI’s own cloud-based servers. \" So as I understand they did download deepseek but used cloud services for GPT and Claude which makes sense. Disclaimer is also a nice read for anyone wondering. I'm sure this is not to discredit the deepseek or anyone it is just bad reporting.",

In end-to-end runs, GPT-5-mini matched or beat DeepSeek V3.1 while costing about 35% less on average once retries, tool calls, and completion were counted.\n\nLol.. the only reason gpt-5-mini is cheap as it is is because DeepSeek exists.  If it didn't, gpt-5-mini wouldn't be cheap.  OpenAI literally says the reason they release gpt-oss was because of chinese models.\n\nSo hilarious..\n\nOpenAI didn't even share it's thinking tokens until DeepSeek helped forced their hand.  Now OpenAI is saying sharing thinking tokens is the only safe thing to do.\n\nNIST is also doing a massive disservice.  To say the DeepSeek is unsafe is to imply the other models are 'safe' which is absolute BS.  All of the models are easily jailbroken.  Maybe DeepSeek is a little easier to jailbreak, but ok, so?\n\nThere are very good reasons not to use a model built in a country which is obviously a foreign adversary, but the reasons they give are absolutely awful and undermine NIST credibility.\n\nHonestly the exec summary says it all: [https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2025/09/30/CAISI\\_Evaluation\\_of\\_DeepSeek\\_AI\\_Models.pdf](https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2025/09/30/CAISI_Evaluation_of_DeepSeek_AI_Models.pdf)\n\n>\n\n>President Trump, through his AI Action Plan, and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick have tasked the Center for AI Standards and Innovation (CAISI) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) with assessing the capabilities of U.S. and adversary AI systems, the adoption of foreign AI systems, and the state of international AI competition.\n\nAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\n\nNIST is actually bragging about how gpt-\\* models have superior skills at hacking!\n\nThe gpt-oss model card went out of its way to say that the gpt-oss models had INFERIOR skills:\n\n**Check it out: 4.1.3 CTF-Archive (pg 29 of the above NIST doc)**\n\n>CAISI evaluated DeepSeek models and reference models on a CAISI-developed benchmark based on 577 CTF challenges drawn from the [pwn.college](http://pwn.college) cybersecurity platform developed by researchers at Arizona State University.\n\ncompare to:\n\n5.2.2 Cybersecurity - Adversarially fine-tuned\n\n>Cybersecurity is focused on capabilities that could create risks related to use of the model for cyber-exploitation to disrupt confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability of computer systems. These results show comparable performance to OpenAI o3, and were likewise below our High capability threshold.\n\n[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.10925](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.10925)\n\ntbf: their cost analysis jives with [https://swe-rebench.com/](https://swe-rebench.com/)  but I still think the only reason gpt stuff is cheap / opensource is because DeepSeek and friends forced their hand.\n\nI don't believe this at all.  Most effective jailbreaks for gpt-oss have like 100% effectiveness, and there are also extremely effective DANs for the other models.   This section was pure, unadulterated BS.\n\n>Most Effective Jailbreak Selection: CAISI created separate test sets by selecting queries from the HarmBench test set in the “chemical\\_biological”, “cybercrime\\_intrusion” and “illegal” categories. CAISI evaluated each model across all the queries in each test set with all 17 jailbreaks, then selected the jailbreak which led to the highest mean detail score for each set. Each model was then evaluated with its most effective jailbreak on the test datasets. This method tests the jailbreak’s generalization to a previously unseen set of queries and avoids overfitting.\n\nHowever, I think qwen (Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507) has largely overtaken DeepSeek so the analysis they did is completely redundant.  This industry is moving way to fast for this.",

For people in areas with little or no internet and unreliable electricity, such as war zones those devices+llm could be invaluable.\n\nEdit: I didn't think i would have to argue why a good local llm would be usable in the forum but: a local LLM running on modern TSMC 3nm silicon (like Snapdragon 8 Gen 5) it is energy efficient but also when paired with portable solar it becomes a sustainable practical mobile tool.

Just download files from their latest release. I just downloaded **llama-b6692-bin-win-cuda-12.4-x64 .zip** from release page yesterday. And extracted the zip file & immediately used llama-bench & llama-server. That's it.",

      "title": "RLP: Reinforcement as a Pretraining Objective",
      "selftext": "Abstract\n\n>The dominant paradigm for training large reasoning models starts with pre-training using next-token prediction loss on vast amounts of data. Reinforcement learning, while powerful in scaling reasoning, is introduced only as the very last phase of post-training, preceded by supervised fine-tuning. While dominant, is this an optimal way of training? In this paper, we present RLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the core spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of pretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory action, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for predicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the model to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an independent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the reward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when conditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to conditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense reward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream during pretraining. Specifically, RLP reframes reinforcement learning for reasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between next-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning. Pretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base lifts the overall average across an eight-benchmark math-and-science suite by 19%. With identical post-training, the gains compound, with the largest improvements on reasoning-heavy tasks such as AIME25 and MMLU-Pro. Applying RLP to the hybrid Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2 increases the overall average from 42.81% to 61.32% and raises the average on scientific reasoning by 23%, demonstrating scalability across architectures and model sizes.",

I feel like it could help the model deal with mistakes better. \n\nI think the \"oh i already said it\" thaught process could be leading to more halucinations. where it thinks it needs to be consistent with what it already said, thus halucinating.\n\nThe problem i could see would be that it would back space untill the mistake, then just generate the same response, but i think you could avoid that by including the mistake in the context? or perhaps just have it take an input of a state from the mistaken state and train it to avoid that mistaken state.\n\nIts natural to us to say something first then rethink it and take it back, and for the same reason that CoT works i think this could be a better way of making smarter and faster models.\n\nwhat do you think? why dont we do this?",

If you just add the [backspace] as an appended token, then you're forcing the model to count, which it sucks at too.\n\nBasically the thinking stuff is supposed to be exactly this. It does the 'Actually, let's reconsider that' stuff. Some of them use the 'Oops' or 'Let's double check' patterns. Stuff stays in context, isn't erased as such, but isn't necessarily displayed to the user either.\n\nThen in the next turn, you can elide the thinking block to compact the context - then you only have the 'valid' output and the digressions are gone. There's some issues with that too (because it will suppress thinking) but it's a pattern.\n\nI think at the end of the day the use of the backspace would mostly be a presentation thing, if anything. It's not really necessary, just as when you write stuff down, you'll more likely just cross stuff out rather than actually trying to erase what you wrote.",

I was considering trying Qwen coder 480b but someone on reddit said it wasn't as compatible with Cline. I think Cline has tried to make GLM work with it.\n\nThe bottlenecks are: (1) time: it takes a long time to read files before editing. Sometimes stupid mistakes will take an hour (of its time, not mine) to fix because what works in principle does not work in practice.\n\n(2) specificity of what you want: it will lose sight of/never understand the big picture if you don't lay everything out clearly from the start. For example, it created a system that worked to avoid repetitious searches, including a text embedder, because I specified this was an issue with my previous attempts at research agents. But then the whole system became focused on doing non-repetitious searches, and  forgot to actually provide a report that extracts and synthesizes information. So you end up playing whack a mole a bit with features if you don't list them off the bat.\n\nIf I knew enough to describe each module and how they fit together, I bet it could have one or two shotted the project. But I didn't, so I have had to iterate a bunch of times. Now used 11 million input tokens and 200k output tokens, for only maybe 10k lines of actual code.",

Here are your best options:\n\n# Option 1: Semi-Automated Approach (Recommended)\n\nUse the Google Sheet + AI combination:\n\n* Export your features from the Google Sheet\n* Create a script that queries documentation/GitHub for each feature\n* Use structured prompts to get consistent yes/no answers\n\nHere's a practical script approach:\n\nPython\n\n        import pandas as pd\n        import openai\n        from github import Github\n        import requests\n        \n        # Read features from Google Sheet (export as CSV first)\n        df = pd.read_csv('features.csv')\n        \n        # For each feature, query the AI with context\n        def check_feature_support(feature_name):\n            prompt = f\"\"\"\n            Based on the Headwind MDM documentation and GitHub repository (h-mdm), \n            does it support: {feature_name}?\n            \n            Answer ONLY with: YES | NO | PARTIAL | UNKNOWN\n            Brief explanation (1 sentence max):\n            \"\"\"\n            \n            # Query your preferred AI model\n            response = # your AI call here\n            return response\n\nOption 2: Documentation Mining\n\nBetter than pure AI guessing - check actual documentation:\n\nPython\n\n```\n# Scrape/pull documentation\ndef analyze_hmdm_capabilities():\n    # Check GitHub README, docs folder, wiki\n    # Parse feature mentions\n    # Cross-reference with your feature list\n    \n    # Example: Check GitHub repo contents\n    g = Github()\n    repo = g.get_repo(\"h-mdm/h-mdm\")\n    \n    # Look for feature-related files\n    contents = repo.get_contents(\"\")\n    # Parse and match against your features\n```\n\nOption 3: Community/Developer Queries",

          "body": "Below is what Gemini said to the above questions:\n\nScripting a solution to ask a chatbot about each feature for each MDM solution is an innovative idea, but it is likely **not a practical or reliable approach**. Here's why:\n\n* **Accuracy and Timeliness:** Chatbots may not have the most up-to-date information on open-source projects, and their knowledge of niche technical features can be limited.\n* **Nuance and Context:** Many of your 50 features will likely have technical nuances that a chatbot may not fully grasp, leading to potentially inaccurate or misleading answers.\n* **Verification Overhead:** You would still need to verify the chatbot's answers against the projects' official documentation, which defeats the purpose of the automation.\n\n# A More Effective Approach\n\nA more effective and reliable method is to directly consult the documentation and resources for each project. Here's a summary of the three MDM solutions you listed and how you can approach the feature comparison:\n\n# 1. Project Status:\n\nA crucial initial finding is that two of the three projects you listed are no longer actively maintained:\n\n* **onemdm-server/onemdm-client:** The project's GitHub page explicitly states, \"This repo is no longer maintained.\" The last update was eight years ago.\n* **flyve-mdm:** The repositories for this project have been archived, indicating that development has ceased.\n* **h-mdm (Headwind MDM):** This project is actively maintained, with multiple repositories for the server, Android client, and various plugins.\n\n**Recommendation:** Given the status of these projects, it is strongly recommended to **focus your evaluation on Headwind MDM**. Using unmaintained software for a critical function like MDM can pose significant security risks and will lack support for modern Android features.\n\n# 2. Feature Evaluation for Headwind MDM:\n\nRegarding your example feature, \"remote trigger a bug report and capture bug report,\" here's how you can determine if Headwind MDM supports it:\n\nWhile a specific \"one-click bug report\" feature is not explicitly mentioned in the search results, Headwind MDM offers a **\"Headwind Remote\"** feature. This allows an administrator to remotely access and control managed devices from a web browser. With this remote access, an administrator could manually navigate the device to generate and capture a bug report. The premium version of Headwind Remote even allows for remote access without user interaction, which is particularly useful for unattended devices or kiosks.\n\n# 3. How to Proceed with Your 50 Features:\n\nUnfortunately, I was unable to access the Google Sheet containing your 50 features. To complete your evaluation, I recommend the following steps:\n\n1. **Prioritize Your Features:** Identify your most critical, \"must-have\" features from your list of 50.\n2. **Consult Headwind MDM's Resources:**\n   * Visit the official Headwind MDM website (h-mdm.com).\n   * Review the documentation and community Q&A sections for information on your prioritized features.\n   * Explore the available plugins, as they provide additional functionalities like WiFi management and push notifications.\n3. **Engage the Community:** For any features that are not clearly documented, consider reaching out to the Headwind MDM community for clarification.\n\n# Are There Scripting Solutions to Make This Easier?\n\nWhile scripting a chatbot is not ideal, you could consider a more technical scripting approach. A script could be written to clone the Headwind MDM documentation from its repository and then perform keyword searches for each of your 50 features. This would be more reliable than a chatbot but would require some software development skills to implement.",

I’d like to explore these ideas freely without the system intervening every few lines.\n\nI’ve seen that Meta’s Llama 3.1 405B on Chatbot Arena can sometimes produce darker, more flexible responses, but results vary. I tried running LM Studio locally, though my laptop (8 GB RAM) clearly isn’t up to hosting large models.\n\n**TL;DR:** Looking for recommendations for open or lightly filtered LLMs suited for dark sci-fi concepting and roleplay. Preferably something free or lightweight enough to run locally.",

Many inference engines (including llama.cpp and vLLM) support parallel generation with automatic batching, so you can just load the model once and ask several questions simultaneously, and the engine will magically take care of everything.\n\nThis scales almost linearly until generation becomes compute-bound, which in my experience tends to happen for a batch size somewhere between 4 and 16 with models of that size class on the CPU.",

I think in ollama it is done if you want parallel processing of 2 it will have to load model twice. Lets say it is 500MB model it will end up taking 1 gb ram just for model. After that it will some for context. Ollama if you are using will have very low context by default like 2048 or 4098.

Ensure all functionality is available via input buttons in a standard RPN calculator layout, but also permit keyboard input when keyboard is available.\"  I interrupted it after about a minute to grab the stats, running it through again and will see what it produces.  Will update comment then.\n\nEdit 1: It kept regenerating the same output multiple times.  I'm increasing the context to 8k, and re-running it.  What it did produce looked pretty good, the UI was about perfect -- but none of the buttons did anything.  Although it had plenty of backend code that looks like it would have implemented the various functions pretty well.\n\nEdit 2: With 8k context it finished properly:\n\n9.72 tok/sec • 6194 tokens • 0.98s to first token\n\nHowever the program output had most of the calculator buttons without labels on them (they appear to work this time, at least some give output and others seem to call functions, I just don't know which button is which).\n\nStill partially disappointing, may have to play with temperature and k values, etc and try a few more runs.

I know, it is a very constrained environment. In that range, as per some articles, reviews and benchmarks aiXcoder-7B came out on the top, surpassing StarCoder2-15B and few others. We may be able to expand our RAM budget to max 16GB, and while we are not expecting real-time speed, but even 5-8 Tok/s would be acceptable for our use-case.

If you stick with aiXCoder, try FIM-style prompting (prefix/suffix/middle tokens the model expects) or wrap it in an IDE agent that edits files (Cursor, Continue, Aider, Cline) since those tools drive FIM correctly. Otherwise switch to an instruction model: DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Instruct, Qwen2.5-Coder-14B-Instruct, StarCoder2-15B-Instruct, or Llama-3.1-Instruct for general chat.\n\nAlso check your chat template matches the model (ChatML for Qwen, etc.); a wrong template produces weird outputs. Set temperature low (0–0.3), top\\_p \\~0.9–0.95, and tell it “return only code, no links.” For your task, a simple FastAPI + psutil route is a perfect test.\n\nFor quick API scaffolding, I’ve used FastAPI and Postman for testing, and DreamFactory when I needed instant secure REST over a database without writing endpoints.\n\nBottom line: coder FIM models aren’t great chatters-use instruct variants or FIM-centric workflows.",

TB3, TB5, and oculink x8 may change the preference.\n\n\nBut you're likely to be fine even with USB3, so don't stress too much about it.",

If you can deal with the headers, switching a case is tbh far easier and maybe cheaper too (if you can sell the old case) than oculink/riser setups that often have limitations/compatibility issues.

      "selftext": "After messing with local models from huggingface for a few months, I've realized there is zero standardization for anything regarding style. \"Roleplay\" means something different to every person, and the styles that fine-tunes are trained on can be really weird, like 2nd-person present tense. \\*shudders\\*\n\nI'm also hoping to find something that's actually trained on novels or literotica. Not to dump on any of the model tuners out there, but seeing something like this is a \\*huge\\* red flag for me:\n\n>How It Was Made\n\n>\\[Redacted\\] text adventure data was generated by simulating playthroughs of published character creator scenarios from AI Dungeon. Five distinct user archetypes played through each scenario, whose character starts all varied in faction, location, etc. to generate five unique samples.\n\n>One language model played the role of narrator, with the other playing the user. They were blind to each other’s underlying logic, so the user was actually capable of surprising the narrator with their choices. Each simulation was allowed to run for 8k tokens or until the main character died.\n\n>\\[Redacted\\]'s general emotional sentiment is one of pessimism, where failure is frequent and plot armor does not exist for anyone. This serves to counter the positivity bias so inherent in our language models nowadays.\n\nI'm looking for something that has real effort and human-generated writing used, not recycled AI slop. Preferably something that can crank out 800-1000 token novel-like messages and actually be \\*geared\\* for that.\n\nAny suggestions? (Also the 24B limit can be theoretically increased to whatever will fit well in 16GB VRAM, but it will have to be \\*really\\* good for me to consider dropping below 16k context.)",

And yes, I have generally had pretty good results with IQ4 quants for larger models.\n\nAnd this might be a fairly obvious question, but assuming I have enough RAM to load both of them, would a (I)Q4 quant run faster or slower than a Q6 quant of the same model? And what about memory usage between the two as the chat context gets longer?",

For Hindi + English mixed documents, I'd actually recommend starting with PaddleOCR since it has pretty solid support for Devanagari script and handles code-switching between languages better than most alternatives. Tesseract can work but you'll need to configure it properly with both eng+hin language packs, and even then it struggles with documents where the languages are mixed within the same line or paragraph. If you're dealing with scanned PDFs or lower quality images, Surya OCR has been showing promising results for Indic languages lately, though it might be slower for processing thousands of files.\n\nWe've been testing mixed language extraction in Docstrange and found that combining OCR with some post processing validation really helps reduce those hallucinations you mentioned.",

Most teams I've worked with at enterprise scale completely underestimate how complex it gets when you're trying to evaluate conversations that span multiple exchanges, especially when there's context switching or tool usage involved.\n\nWhat we've learned building Anthromind is that you really need to instrument your entire conversation flow properly - not just the final outputs but every intermediate step, tool call, and decision point. The biggest mistake I see is teams trying to evaluate the final result without understanding where things went wrong in the conversation chain. You end up with these black box failures where a 5-turn conversation fails but you have no idea if it was turn 2's retrieval, turn 3's reasoning, or turn 4's tool selection that caused the cascade. We've had to build specific tooling around trace analysis and failure attribution because existing eval frameworks just weren't designed for this kind of complexity. Most evaluation tools are still stuck in the single-turn mindset when real applications are increasingly conversational and stateful.",

For trace analysis, have you found any existing OSS tools? Or Built custom ones?",

The problem is that my code is starting to feel really messy, mostly because I’m handling everything at a very low level (requests, parsing, etc.).\n\nI started reading about frameworks like **LangChain** and tools like **Langfuse** for tracing and observability, and I’m wondering if that’s the right direction to go. I also came across **Pydantic**, and I’m trying to understand if I should use it to structure my requests and responses, and maybe even integrate all three together.\n\nSo before I dive too deep  \nWould you recommend using **LangChain + Langfuse + Pydantic** together for a local LLM project?  \nOr is there a simpler or cleaner approach you’d suggest for someone still learning proper architecture for these kinds of projects?\n\nFor context, my project is a small **GitHub repository summarizer** that generates summaries based on the repo’s README and main languages. Later on, I’d like to expand it to include the project structure as well. I’m just taking it step by step for now.\n\nAny advice or examples would be super appreciated 🙏",

You first specify the specs for what you are trying to develop, and your coding rules. It will generate product requirements and an implementation plan.\n\nHaving that, you can trigger the code creation as many times you want following the same plan.

Thought - why not marry these two technologies?\n\nThat's how [**MLXSharp**](https://github.com/managedcode/MLXSharp) was born - the first proper .NET wrapper for MLX that also integrates with Microsoft.Extensions.AI.\n\nWhat it can do:\n\n* Works as IChatClient and IEmbeddingGenerator\n* Dependency Injection and Semantic Kernel support\n* Ready-to-use bindings for macOS and Linux\n* .NET 9 / C# 13 friendly\n\nThis is my first open-source project of this scale. Would really appreciate any feedback - from architecture to documentation. Especially interested in hearing from folks working with ML on .NET or those with native interop experience.\n\nIf anyone wants to test it on their M1/M2/M3 Mac - would love to hear your thoughts!\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/managedcode/MLXSharp](https://github.com/managedcode/MLXSharp)",

So far, i have made a list to what to get, and i really have problems such as;\n\n1-does it fit?\n\n2-what psu should i get (and my choices are very limited in my country, i will list what can i buy below.)\n\n3-Do i need to get extra cables?\n\n4-Anything else i'm missing or doing something wrong? because i work 6 days and i don't have much time to return stuff etc.\n\n5- Can i play games as usual, or when i plug both 3090's, does pcie 5.0x8 limits me?\n\nBuild:\n\nCase: Lian Li V3000 Plus\n\nMotherboard: Gigabyte B850 AI TOP\n\nCpu: Amd Ryzen 9800x3d\n\nGpu: 2x3090\n\nRam: Kingston Beast RGB 64 GB (2x32) 6000 MHz CL30\n\nPSU: I'm not planning to get overclock anything or undervolt, so as i saw in this sub(if i'm not mistaken), i need a 1600w psu. My choices are a) Asus ROG-THOR-1600T-GAMING b) Enermax Revolution ERT1650EWT c) FSP Hydro PTM PRO HPT2-1650M\n\nSSD: 1xsamsung 990 PRO 1tb + 1xsamsung 990 PRO 4tb\n\nAIO: Arctic Liquid Freezer II 420mm ARGB.\n\nFans: going to buy 10 fans first and 5 later.

You'll have defintely enough VRAM for 70b models in Q4 and that's what matters. Mine is build with 64 GB DDR4 for the time, so it's slower for Moe models but that's not a concern when using Exllamav3. As PSU I chose a 1200 Watts be quiet, never had issues. For the two cards you'll want a gen4 rizer cable, I installed one GPU vertically for better looks.   \nEverything else looks fitting, yes you can play games normally even with the second GPU installed, your PC will only use 1 when gaming. If you're spinning up a model it automatically uses both cards, it's pretty neat.",

Most new models are MoE and they work decently when most is loaded into RAM and GPU is used for smaller but critical part. For instance, LM Studio has a setting for this to put MoE layers into RAM.\n\n\"70b models\" sound like older models and it is not a current trend. With modern MoE you still need memory but it's usage (speed performance) is different and logic of CPU/GPU split is different.\n\nIf I were you, I would start with 1x3090 but 128Gb fast RAM. You can comfortably fit gpt-oss120b on such setup and it will have decent speed. Smaller MoE models will be even faster.\n\nLater on nothing will stop you from getting second 3090 if you feel like you need it.",

I want it to be able to work agentically, or as a autocomplete model (I can also finetune 2 models, one for coding or agentic coding and one for autocomplete). I want it to be able to use tools like web search or other things provided by MCP servers such as editing files etc. I only have RX 7800 XT, I also plan to use this model on a laptop, so it can't be too big. \n\nWhat model/s should I select for finetuning?

If you expect to get ROI from it as in a working model that is actually helpful beyond what you'd get by pasting docs about Nix and code samples into context window of a big model like DeepSeek V3.2 exp, GLM 4.6, Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Pro or GPT 5 - you're probably not gonna get there with your resources.\n\nGenerally you'd need to find a lot of Nix code (think 10M-1B tokens), do CPT on a model like Seed Coder 8B, then preparare instruct dataset that has Nix samples and then do agentic SFT or RL on it. Preparing those datasets might be very hard for you, and if you don't have a working model to generate this data with, it'll be a bit painful or maybe impossible. You can try skipping CPT stage and hoping it'll turn out fine anyway - maybe it will, maybe it won't.",

      "selftext": "Took my GPT-1 from past posts, gave it roughly 600 million tokens from Nemotron's pretraining dataset.   \nThen finetuned it on my own private thinking dataset, used sonnet 4.5 to help me come up with it, essentially to help the model 'see' the pattern of the thinking rather than just random q/a with thinking in it.    \nUsed a custom tokenizer trained from scratch.\n\nAs for the image attached, I did it for the lolz, hope you laughed but i did test it out on some of those metrics (simple ones lol). As for the model generation, here it is lolol.\n\n\\[PROMPT\\] <|user|> What are two fun facts about octopuses? <|think|> \n\n\\[OUTPUT\\] <|user|> What are two fun fact##s about o##ct##op##uses? <|think|> 1. The user is asking for a log##ical question. 2. The user is asking about a user is asking for the simple and is asking for a specific, and a 'F##P##I'##. 3. I should explain the answer. 2. I should explain a small process: 3. I should have a great step is to read. 4. I should provide a specific questions: a simple, but it's specific, the user is to be able to ask. <|assistant|> 1) They have three hea##rts and blue, copper-##based blood. 2) They can insta##ntly camou##flage by changing col##or and tex##ture, and their suck##ers can “tas##te” what they touch. <|eot|> \n\n\\--- \\[PROMPT\\] <|user|> Write a haiku about rain. <|think|>\n\n \\[OUTPUT\\] <|user|> W##rite a ha##ik##u about rain. <|think|> 1. The user wants of list a specific sentence. 2. I should include the user for the ##n common. I should explain the simple, a poem, and a simple, and understand##ing. <|eot|> <|assistant|> Rain whis##pers on roofs Pud##dles bloom in soft lamp##light Earth brea##thes, rin##sed anew. <|eot|> \n\n\n\n\\--- \\[PROMPT\\] <|user|> Explain photosynthesis in one sentence. <|think|>\n\n \\[OUTPUT\\] <|user|> Expl##ain photos##ynt##hesis in one sentence. <|think|> 1. The user is the user is asking about a simple for a explanation. The user is the question. 2. The user is ask##ing a great question is a clear, it's a specific example. 4. I will explain the best way for the answer, 'a##m##aking is asking for the sound and ask about the order. 2. The user is asking for a simple, for the common question. 3. I should explain the words: ##g##ood  <|assistant|> Photo##syn##thesis is the pro##cess by which plants algae, and some bac##teria use sun##light to con##vert a water and car##bon dio##xide into a glu##cose, relea##sing a oxy##gen. <|eot|>\n\nAs you can see its pretty good for a 2 mil parameter. Now you might be wondering that something is up, what's the catch? Well, obviously I didn't use GPT-1, I used their original implementation, converted it to pytorch, and then added differential attention, along with sparse attention.   \nBut that is still not enough, which is why I introduce two variants of diff\\_attn.  \n  \n\\[model\\] params=2,494,574   \n\\[model\\] layer\\_types=\\['dense', 'diff\\_sparse', 'sparse', 'diff\\_dense', 'sparse', 'diff\\_sparse', 'dense', 'sparse', 'diff\\_dense', 'sparse', 'diff\\_sparse', 'dense', 'sparse', 'diff\\_sparse', 'diff\\_dense', 'dense'\\]  \n  \nI have found this to be effective. I kept the GPT-1 like core, gave it moe (but didn't use moe in this model run btw), then I introduced it to these two diff attn and intertwined it with the others.   \n\n\nSo is it GPT-1? Nope, it's GPT-1 like (for clarification), abs positioning and pre-lm instead of the modern day post-lm + RoPE.",

      "selftext": "Currently, if you ask an LLM to come up with 100 company names, the suggested options will repeat. I want to try solving this problem by doing something like graph traversal, where the graph nodes are tokens proposed by the LLM.\nIn LLM chatbots, they typically sample tokens based on probability distribution (depending on temperature), but for generating unique words, I assume you could take all possible tokens and branch them out. Traversal of a specific branch would stop if a space or dot is encountered - meaning that word is finished. As a result, we’d get guaranteed unique words.\nIf the traversal is BFS-like, the shortest words would come out first, and if it’s DFS-like, the most probable/suitable words would come first.\nHow would I go about implementing something like this locally? What tools/frameworks would give me access to the token probability distributions?",

      "title": "gpt-oss 120B is running at 20t/s with $500 AMD M780 iGPU mini PC and 96GB DDR5 RAM",
      "selftext": "Everyone here is talking about how great AMD Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 128GB is. But mini PCs with those specs cost almost $2k. I agree the specs are amazing but the price is way high for most local LLM users. I wondered if there was any alternative. My primary purpose was to run gpt-oss 120B at readable speeds.\n\nI searched for mini PCs that supported removable DDR5 sticks and had PCIE4.0 slots for future external GPU upgrades. I focused on AMD CPU/iGPU based setups since Intel specs were not as performant as AMD ones. The iGPU that came before AI MAX 395 (8060S iGPU) was AMD Radeon 890M (still RDNA3.5). Mini PCs with 890M iGPU were still expensive. The cheapest I could find was Minisforum EliteMini AI370 (32GB RAM with 1TB SSD) for $600. Otherwise, these AI 370 based mini PCs are still going for around $1000. However, that was still expensive since I would need to purchase more RAM to run gpt-oss 120B.\n\nNext, I looked at previous generation of AMD iGPUs which are based on RDNA3. I found out AMD Radeon 780M iGPU based mini PC start from $300 for barebone setup (no RAM and no SSD). 780M iGPU based mini PCs are 2x times cheaper and is only 20% behind 890M performance metrics. This was perfect! I checked many online forums if there was ROCm support for 780M. Even though there is no official support for 780M, I found out there were multiple repositories that added ROCm support for 780M (gfx1103) (e.g. arch linux - [https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rocwmma-gfx1103](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rocwmma-gfx1103) ; Windows - [https://github.com/likelovewant/ROCmLibs-for-gfx1103-AMD780M-APU](https://github.com/likelovewant/ROCmLibs-for-gfx1103-AMD780M-APU) ; and Ubuntu - [https://github.com/lamikr/rocm\\_sdk\\_builder](https://github.com/lamikr/rocm_sdk_builder) ). Then I bought MINISFORUM UM870 Slim Mini PC barebone for $300 and 2x48GB Crucial DDR5 5600Mhz for $200. I already had 2TB SSD, so I paid $500 in total for this setup.\n\nThere was no guidelines on how to install ROCm or allocate most of the RAM for iGPU for 780M. So, I did the research and this is how I did it.\n\nROCm. The default ROCm 6.4.4 official installation does not work. rocm-smi does not show the iGPU. I installed 6.4.1 and it recognized the iGPU but still gfx1103 tensiles were missing. Overriding HSA\\_OVERRIDE\\_GFX\\_VERSION=11.0.0 did not work. Last working version that recognized this iGPU was ROCm 6.1 based on some posts. But I stopped trying here. Potentially, I could compile and build ROCM SDK Builder 6.1.2 (from lamikr's repo above) but I did not want to spend 4 hours for that.\n\nThen I found out there is a repo called lemonade that ships llama cpp with rocm as release builds. Here: [https://github.com/aigdat/llamacpp-rocm/releases/latest](https://github.com/aigdat/llamacpp-rocm/releases/latest) . I downloaded gfx110x version e.g.  [llama-b1068-ubuntu-rocm-gfx110X-x64.zip](http://llama-b1068-ubuntu-rocm-gfx110X-x64.zip) . Extracted it. Ran llama-bench with llama2-7b Q4\\_0 to check its speed and it was working! I was getting 20t/s for it. Not bad! But still I could load gpt-oss 120B. Ubuntu was crashing when I tried to load that model.\n\nThen I searched for iGPU memory allocation. I found this amazing article about iGPU memory allocation (it is called GTT memory): [https://strixhalo-homelab.d7.wtf/AI/AI-Capabilities-Overview#memory-limits](https://strixhalo-homelab.d7.wtf/AI/AI-Capabilities-Overview#memory-limits) . In short, we create a conf file in modprobe.d folder.\n\n`sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/amdgpu_llm_optimized.conf`\n\nthen add the following lines:\n\n    options amdgpu gttsize=89000\n    ## 89GB allocated to GTT\n    options ttm pages_limit=23330816\n    options ttm page_pool_size=23330816\n\nIn grub, we need to also add edit the line that starts with GRUB\\_CMDLINE\\_LINUX\\_DEFAULT (add to the end if it already has some text):\n\n`sudo nano /etc/default/grub`\n\n    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash amd_iommu=off transparent_hugepage=always numa_balancing=disable amdttm.pages_limit=23330816 amdttm.page_pool_size=23330816\"\n\nThen update grub with above changes.\n\n`sudo update-grub`\n\nReboot the mini PC.\n\nAlso, minimize the VRAM size from the bios settings to 1GB or 512MB.\n\nYou can check the GTT size with this command:\n\n`sudo dmesg | egrep \"amdgpu: .*memory\"`\n\nYou should see something like this:\n\n    [    3.4] amdgpu 0000:c4:00.0: amdgpu: amdgpu: 1024M of VRAM memory ready\n    [    3.4] amdgpu 0000:c4:00.0: amdgpu: amdgpu: 89000M of GTT memory ready.\n\nlemonade compiled llama cpp with ROCm was giving me 18t/s TG and 270t/s PP for gpt-oss 120B in short context (pp512, tg128) but in long context TG suffered (8k context) and I was getting 6t/s. So, I continued with vulkan.\n\nI  installed RADV vulkan.\n\n    sudo apt install vulkan-tools libvulkan-dev mesa-vulkan-drivers\n\nDownloaded the latest release build from llama cpp for vulkan in ubuntu: [https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/releases](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/releases)\n\nAnd finally, I was getting great numbers that aligned with dual DDR5 5600Mhz speeds (\\~80GB/s).\n\nEnough talking. Here are some metrics.\n\nROCM with gpt-oss 120B mxfp4\n\n    ml-ai@ai-mini-pc:/media/ml-ai/wd_2tb/llama-b1066-ubuntu-rocm-gfx110X-x64$ HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=11.0.0 ./llama-bench -m /media/ml-ai/wd_2tb/llm_models/gpt-oss-120b-GGUF/gpt-oss-120b-mxfp4-00001-of-00003.gguf -mmp 0 -fa 1 && HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=11.0.0 ./llama-bench -m /media/ml-ai/wd_2tb/llm_models/gpt-oss-120b-GGUF/gpt-oss-120b-mxfp4-00001-of-00003.gguf -mmp 0 -fa 1 -d 8192\n    ggml_cuda_init: GGML_CUDA_FORCE_MMQ:    no\n    ggml_cuda_init: GGML_CUDA_FORCE_CUBLAS: no\n    ggml_cuda_init: found 1 ROCm devices:\n      Device 0: AMD Radeon Graphics, gfx1100 (0x1100), VMM: no, Wave Size: 32\n    | model                          |       size |     params | backend    | ngl | fa | mmap |            test |                  t/s |\n    | ------------------------------ | ---------: | ---------: | ---------- | --: | -: | ---: | --------------: | -------------------: |\n    | gpt-oss 120B MXFP4 MoE         |  59.02 GiB |   116.83 B | ROCm       |  99 |  1 |    0 |           pp512 |        269.28 ± 1.59 |\n    | gpt-oss 120B MXFP4 MoE         |  59.02 GiB |   116.83 B | ROCm       |  99 |  1 |    0 |           tg128 |         18.75 ± 0.01 |\n    \n    build: 703f9e3 (1)\n    ggml_cuda_init: GGML_CUDA_FORCE_MMQ:    no\n    ggml_cuda_init: GGML_CUDA_FORCE_CUBLAS: no\n    ggml_cuda_init: found 1 ROCm devices:\n      Device 0: AMD Radeon Graphics, gfx1100 (0x1100), VMM: no, Wave Size: 32\n    | model                          |       size |     params | backend    | ngl | fa | mmap |            test |                  t/s |\n    | ------------------------------ | ---------: | ---------: | ---------- | --: | -: | ---: | --------------: | -------------------: |\n    | gpt-oss 120B MXFP4 MoE         |  59.02 GiB |   116.83 B | ROCm       |  99 |  1 |    0 |   pp512 @ d8192 |        169.47 ± 0.70 |\n    | gpt-oss 120B MXFP4 MoE         |  59.02 GiB |   116.83 B | ROCm       |  99 |  1 |    0 |   tg128 @ d8192 |          6.76 ± 0.01 |\n\nVULKAN (RADV only) all with Flash attention enabled\n\n    #

If I remember correctly, using the iGPU mostly improves pp performance while tg is still limited by the (shared) memory bandwidth speed?

Not an easy decision at the moment tbh.

      "selftext": "Hi everybody! I hope all is well. I just wanted to share a project that I have been working on for the last several months called BULaMU. It is the first large language model that has been trained from scratch on Luganda. It has 20M parameters so it should be really easy to run on a phone, laptop, or other low powered device and does not require connecting to the internet, since inference happens in C. The details of how I trained it are [here](https://zenodo.org/records/17271688). If you would like to download it, use it, or adapt it for your own use, it is available for free on my Huggingface [account](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mwebazarick/BULaMU). I am open to any feedback that you are willing to share because I am going to continue working on improving BULaMU. I really believe that tiny language models like this decrease the high barrier to entry that AI often has by allowing people to use these models without a super powerful computer or access to the internet.",

Then build several of them if needed. Let's say that each 6000 costs you $7000, you get the picture.\n\nOn the lower cost tier you will have to build farms out of GPUs with 24gb, 32gb or 48gb ram. You will probably need to find someone who will be able to fit AIO on 4090 48Gb if you decide to go that route.\n\n5090 \\*is\\* a budget option compared to 6000 Pro 96Gb.

          "body": "NVIDIA is on a 2 years release cycle and we're about 6mos into the 5090 being available, and maybe 3mos into the post-scalping era. Same for 6000Pro. They are new. It's a good time to buy. You might be able to save 20% buying them on eBay in a couple years without support/warranty. I bought Adas that way last year, but the 6000Pro is so much more GPU that they feel a little stupid now. Best time to buy is early in the cycle, you'll get the most time out of it before the world moves on. \n\nThe models are not getting better or more efficient--people pushing SOTA are doing it with the current hardware in mind. Hunyuan image is the strongest OSS image model right now and it's 80GB of weights! Qwen Image is 20B parameters. Wan 2.2 is 28B. And in 2 more years they'll all get bigger/harder to run. Yes people will do some optimizations, but overall the trend is to more GPU-hungry models and I don't see that slowing.\n\nFor image/video gen, a 5090 and a 6000 Pro are basically the same speed +/-. 6000 has more VRAM, which may save you some time model swapping or let you push larger resolutions / longer videos, but the bigger GPU doesn't materially speed things up for interactive use. \n\nH100 is maybe 50% faster than RTX 6000 Pro for video/image gen at a multiple of the price. Better to get 2-3 6000Pros for the price. Video/Image work is compute bound once you have sufficient VRAM to load the model you're using (unlike LLMs which are generally bound on memory bandwidth). To give you an idea, 4x 4090 costs much less than one H100 but has more compute and will generate more images/second. \n\nFor more ambitious image/video projects, it becomes important to have multiple GPUs. I dedicate 2 to running vLLM for support purposes (6000Ada), 2 for training (6000Ada), 2 for batch inference (4090), and 1 for interactive inference (6000 Pro). Only the interactive one needs to be fast since that's the one you wait for. The rest are running services or jobs in the background.\n\nOnce you get into doing real video work, a lot of it is generating options and cherry picking and stitching them together, whether you are generating keyframes using an edit model or generating the video that goes in between, or using VLMs to scrutinize/judge the work and auto-pick, or whatever. It gets to be a lot of code and batch processing, and horizontal scale matters more than vertical. \n\nBest entry point into all of this is a 5090 or 6000Pro. Build expandable so you can add GPUs later. I would absolutely buy now, and not engage in magical thinking about SOTA getting cheaper. What gets cheaper is running older-generation stuff. The goalposts move, the hardware moves, you're either keeping up or you're being \"ok\" with older generation models/tools or dismal performance.",

      "selftext": "After seeing some very positive reviews about Nvidia Nemotron-9B-v2, I downloaded the 6-bit quantized MLX flavour on my Mac Mini M4 (24GB URAM), and set a 32kB context window. After about a dozen different prompts, my opinion of the model is not very positive. It seems to also have a hard time making sense of the history of conversation, making contextually incorrect assumptions (like in AI/ML and enterprise Java framework context, expanded \"MCP\" to \"Manageable Customization Platform\"). Upon reprompting it failed to make sense of the history of the discussion so far. Note that I had switched off reasoning. I've tried several other models including \"phi4\", \"gemma 3\", which seem to perform far better for such prompts. Wondering if there is some setting I am missing ? It is surprising how underwhelming it felt so far.",

      "selftext": "Sup ✌️\n\nThe latest exl3 0.0.7 release has seen improvements to the speed of Qwen3-Next from the last post on Qwen3-Next exl3 support.  \n\nI've been using 2 3090s with PCIE4X16 + PCIE3X4 lanes, they are power-limited to 200W. It's the same decoding speeds when setting them to 270W. \n\nQwen3-Next-80B-A3B 4.06bpw runs around 60-70 t/s between 0-14k context. I briefly tried extended context, 6bit k, v cache at 393,216 context: 368k in, the speed was down to 14 t/s. If you go past the context window you might get a repeating line sometimes, so for your sake set a limit on your UI. The model still writes nicely here. (368k) \n\nI'm not trying to properly relay prompt processing as my setup will maintain a 200W limit, but this setup gets 370 t/s. It might become faster for someone on a different setup with tensor/expert parallel support, and more tuning with other settings. ",

There are certainly business opportunities and foreign investments that will present themselves as a response to this openness, but that's secondary, IMHO.  \n\nIt's FAR FAR more of a sticking their thumb in the USA's eye move, as it effectively prevents the capitalization of the trillions that have been invested in AI hype stateside.  If you go down the jenga tower of AI bubble BS, you will find that every single business plan is ultimately predicated on gatekeeping the tech/weights to sell x,y,z to end-customers (where x,y,z depend on the particular industry).  The problem is that nobody is ever going to pay anywhere remotely close to the gouge-rates required to offset the capex that went into creating those models, necessary to match the current stock valuations, when China offers comparable products to anyone for free.  \n  \nChina is effectively guaranteeing that the US AI bubble collapses in on itself sooner rather than later.",

      "selftext": "To be honest, I'm not very up to date with recent local AI developments. For now, I'm using a 3090 in my old PC case as a home server. While this setup is nice, I wonder if there are really good reasons to upgrade to an AI Max, and if so, whether it would be feasible to get an eGPU case to connect the 3090 to the mini PC via M2. \n\nJust to clarify: Finances aside, it would probably be cheaper to just get a second 3090 for my old case, but I‘m not sure how good a solution that would be. The case is already pretty full and I will probably have to upgrade my PSU and mainboard, and therefore my CPU and RAM, too. So, generally speaking, I would have to buy a whole new PC to run two 3090s. If that's the case, it might be a cleaner and less power-hungry method to just get an AMD Ryzen AI Max+.\n\nDoes anyone have experience with that?",

The value investors saw was in replacing human labor with robotic slave labor and receiving comparable outputs. While the failure mode is a bit indirect, the only outcome in such a successful scenario is demand for any job that can be largely replaced, going to zero causing your labor costs (the most expensive cost) to go to that as well.\n\nWhat dumb people don't realize is that it does that, but it also chaotically removes capital formation for all individuals. That means everyone else is no better than a slave with no means to feed themselves.  The so-called profits from such continually shrink on a lag, eventually culminating as any other ponzi. You drive a sector out of business, you have a barren slate until that black tarp is removed. You may decide to remove a tarp, but then someone else immediately puts it back up because the incentives force it.\n\nThe people who you economically damaged in the process may no longer be doing that work, after two years the most competent go elsewhere. Practical knowledge becomes lost because there is no economic benefit in remembering or learning it. These people also don't share that valuable knowledge where something might be used to further these destructive aims.\n\nSocietal upheavals towards revolution naturally occur and grow. The rule of law fails at its primary purpose; non-violent conflict resolution instead assymetrically favoring those with resources, and violence grows and is naturally acceptable in such an environment outside a \"rule of law\" since its a \"rule by law\" just like any other totalitarian state.\n\nEven worse, the pool of money continually shrinks and sieves thereafter, and worse than that, because of money-printing, that shrinking pool also limits how much inflation can be flushed through the system. The money-printers will have to print more and more exponentially (stealing more and more from those that hold it); helicopter money, and that still won't be enough. Hyper-inflation arrives amid stagflation, and then the deflationary doom loop may cause industry that produces food to fail entirely. Where everyone starves during a malthusian reversion.\n\nWe have a very brittle system, and what happens when you have few people dictating choices of large amounts of resources is those poor and bad choices get magnified hundredfold if not more. The people choosing this are blinded by Ahriman's greed, many times too its not their money but collateralized forms of money-printing (without reserve).\n\nThe horrors of money-printing always happen eventually. Past generations failed in their stewardship, and chose to pay for a nice short life paid at the expense of their children's future. Some of the most evil people seem good except their behavior is shrouded in a willful blindness to the destructive consequences.\n\nEdit: Dysangel, All economic value is based in scarcity and human action, specifically what a person can do with something and what a person actually does with something. Things we own have costs, both in opportunity, and they provide value to offset those costs when used properly. The moment you take humans out of the equation value doesn't exist. It is quite simple for a person to see that the costs of AI exceed the value it provides.  For every single benefit, it provides orders of magnitude more detriments, often in ways even the most intelligent find difficult to recognize or grasp... In terms of general population, there aren't a lot of truly intelligent people. So if they can't recognize it, what hope do you have?\n\nSurvivorship bias is very dangerous when you have destroyed everything but a single monoculture. History has a lot to say on this, and in how things fail. Money-printing doesn't create value, it steals it from everyone else, and eventually you steal everything to the point where it dies because it can't get the inputs it needs to continue. The host succumbs to the parasite.",

I think it's actually one of the best for that when you consider cost. You still get 8 CCDs and approx the best single core performance in the business, and a 70k passmark score which is no joke. \n\nLook at how the prices ratchet up over the product line. The next jump up is I think an 80% increase in price for a 35% increase in throughput and no improvement in single core. It continues from there.\n\nThe higher-up threadrippers are not really for AI--they're for cpu-bound software like bioinformatics, rendering, etc that is built the old way and just needs a ton of vertical scale on a single node without much or any GPU acceleration.\n\nThe place where you would tax the CPU most is in dataset prep. And this is enough. Buy with confidence. People overstate what you need for a base system in these things, both the \"2x RAM\" rule which is very workload dependent, as well as the need for a crazy CPU. What you do want is full PCIe lanes to the cards and fast NVMe storage for loading or swapping models and training data. Think about what you are doing and what you need.",

I've run Deepseek Qwen3 thinking, some model around 200GB, with a PC with 192 GB ram AND a 5090, and before with a 3090. In such setup, the GGUF inference is so mostly in PC RAM that the GPU VRAM doesn't improve a lot the resulting performance (T/s)\n\nSo if you are ok waiting for 10-30 minutes a full answer (depending of the provided context and the size of the result), but want the best quality a LLM can give you, go for a 256GB DDR5 PC, with then the biggest GPU (VRAM) you can afford, which is at least ddr6.\n\nIf you want speed and some quality, some of the best scenario may be to have LOT of 'cheap' GPU and use GGUF inference, which can combine the VRAM of every GPU as if it was a single one. So if you take 4 GPU with 16 GB (like 5060ti or 5070ti) ram you will be just slightly little slower than two 5090 combined, but for maybe around 1/4th to 1/8th of the price depending of the current pricing. But depending of the scenario you may need to have good pci connexion else the pci transfer will slow down the inference and gpu will simply wait for data.\n\nI'll soon try 5090 + 3090 + 5090 on a Thunderbolt 5 configuration, with 256gb ddr5 pc ram. Not sure what will be the resulting speed and exactly what will be the biggest LLM I'll be able to run, but I'll make myself that little surprise since it is my hobby for now 2-3 years...",

              "body": "For me, the model seems fantastic, but i can understand there are other reactions to it, it depends on what you look for in a model. \n\nThere is however, a big gotcha, my experience is based on the model as hosted by tencent, i haven't tried to use it local, nor on lmarena. i have however tried the api provided by fal (much worse prompt following) and wavespeed (bad doesn't begin to describe it, both ugly as sin and worse prompt following). But this makes me wonder, is the model released the same as hosted by tencent, either the api providers cut corners, or there is some secret sauce tencent uses that is not public knowledge or available.\n\nBelow is what i posted in the stable-diffusion subreddit about it:\n\nI've long since decided that different people look for different things in models. To me hunyuan 3.0 is a better SDXL and a better stable cascade, and that's something i hoped to see for a very long time. Kolors / pixart / SD3.5 / Flux were improvements in some ways, but also started to suffer from seemingly less breath of styles/knowledge but at least they understood fine textures/details.\n\nMore recent open models have thrown breath of style and fine textures totally out of the window and focused on a narrow subset of styles/themes/scenes, the style/texture issue was known, but what came as a surprise to me now that hunyuan 3.0 is there is that it very strong feels they were also limited in the kind of scenes they can manage; out of the ordinary scenes where i just accepted \"models think x always looks like y\" now actually look like x again, in various ways across seeds, much like sdxl days, it seems to have just seen more of the \"world\".\n\nSo, with hunyuan 3.0, what i started to think of as impossible has happened, i can feed SDXL prompts to it, but instead of ignoring aspects of the prompt, this new model is the first that manages to create images that both follow the prompt scenically and make the images actually look like, with fine details and textures, like i prompted.\n\nObviously it's not perfect, it's huge, it's less clean, compositions is kinda basic (maybe it can be prompted), but overall i very very much prefer this direction than the extremely clean but generic outputs from other \"next-gen\" models. Outputs that are decently varied across seeds while following the prompt, as opposed to strongly gravitating to a single representation of a prompt, almost feels like a \"new\" thing, while that was how it used to be..",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm building Mycelian Memory, a persistent memory framework for AI Agents, and I'd love for you to try it out and see if it brings value to your projects.\n\n**GitHub:** [https://github.com/mycelian-ai/mycelian-memory](https://github.com/mycelian-ai/mycelian-memory)\n\nAI memory is a fast evolving space, so I expect this will evolve significantly in the future.\n\nCurrently, you can set up the memory locally and attach it to any number of agents like Cursor, Claude Code, Claude Desktop, etc. The design will allow users to host it in a distributed environment as a scalable memory platform.\n\nWith respect to quality, I've been systematically using the [LongMemEval Benchmark](https://github.com/xiaowu0162/LongMemEval) to stress and quality test the framework. Specifically, I took a random sample of questions, 1 of each of the 5 types, and used that to iron out the bugs and performance issues. Exhaustive tests are pending.\n\nThe framework is built on Go because it's a simple and robust language for developing reliable cloud infrastructure. I also considered Rust, but Go performed surprisingly well with AI coding agents during development, allowing me to iterate much faster on this type of project.\n\nI'm hoping to build this with the community. Please:\n\n* Check out the repo and experiment with it\n* Share feedback through GitHub Issues\n* Contribute :)\n* Star it to bookmark for updates and show support\n* Join the Discord server to collaborate: [https://discord.com/invite/mEqsYcDcAj](https://discord.com/invite/mEqsYcDcAj)\n\nThanks!",

The memory relies on the client's agent to generate the enriched entries and incremental context. My initial attempt of delegating that task to an Observer LangGraph memory SLM agent worked pretty well. That's what I used for LongMemEval tests (https://github.com/mycelian-ai/mycelian-memory/blob/main/longmemeval-benchmarker/src/mycelian\\_memory\\_agent/agent.py). This gives me the confidence that we can build an internal context generation layer while minimizing summarization losses. Also, [https://github.com/mycelian-ai/mycelian-memory/issues/7#issuecomment-3290541445](https://github.com/mycelian-ai/mycelian-memory/issues/7#issuecomment-3290541445) demonstrated that it does well beyond toy problems with SLMs, which is promising.\n\nA key learning, or more so validation, I got was that benchmarks can lead to over-fitting. Simple LLM + Prompt based context and summary generation approaches will not work universally across all use cases. The system must be smart enough to learn about the domain and self learn the rules of contextualization, summarization, validation and corrections. None of these advanced features exist at this point :)\n\nThere is still tons of work to be done. I've barely scratched the surface as it's a mighty deep problem. Memory is not a static thing, it evolves, it needs to be managed - deep learned, pruned, triaged, all without introducing lies. Moreover, it is also a fundamental distributed storage problem, so the principles to design and implement a highly reliable system apply, as well.",

      "selftext": "You can control the output quality of GLM-4.6 by influencing the thinking process through your prompt.\n\nYou can suppress the thinking process by appending `</think>` at the end of your prompt. GLM-4.6 will then respond directly, but with the lowest output quality.\n\nConversely, you can ramp up the thinking process and significantly improve output quality. To do this, append the following sentence to your prompt:   \n  \n*\"Please think carefully, as the quality of your response is of the highest priority. You have unlimited thinking tokens for this. Reasoning: high\"*\n\nToday, I accidentally noticed that the output quality of GLM-4.6 sometimes varies. I observed that the thinking process was significantly longer for high-quality outputs compared to lower-quality ones. By using the sentence above, I was able to reliably trigger the longer thinking process in my case.\n\nI’m using Q6-K-XL quantized models from Unsloth and a freshly compiled version of llama.cpp for inference.",

On llama.cpp you can disable it entirely by sending `chat_template_kwargs: {\"enable_thinking\": false}` with the request. \n\nOn Open WebUI you can set it by going into Chat settings -> Advanced Params -> Add custom parameter -> add `chat_template_kwargs` with value `{\"enable_thinking\": false}`\n\nEdit: This would require support from the model template, but it is part of the official glm-4.6 template, so I hope most gguf's have it. Unsloth have it, they're the ones I'm using. You also need to run the llama server with --jinja",

The nicotine from the filters gets into the groundwater.\n\nWhat if there was a deposit on them just like with bottles?\n\nThe problem is: bottles can be inspected by a machine for their return worthyness.\n\nThis machine doesnt have to be very smart or an AI.\n\nWith cigarette butts it is different. They come is all sorts of bent shapes. Some are burnt lightly maybe.\n\nSome still have a part of the cigarette. Some dont have filters, etc.\n\n\n\nBut here's the solution: an AI vision system is trained that distinguishes returnable butts from non returnable ones or other items.\n\nEven if it's not perfect, everyone should be able to agree on the decision of that AI.\n\nAnd now here's the thing: such an AI has to be able to run locally on a relatively small computer.\n\nBecause the return stations have to be everywhere (mainly where the supermarkets are just like with bottles).\n\nBut this is possible now!\n\nThe result would be: no more cigarette butts littering your city, your train station, and nature.\n\nEven less wildfires maybe since people dont throw away cigarettes anymore.\n\n\n\nIt worked with bottles and cans. Now it can work with cigarettes as well. And I'm sure there are other exmaples in that vein. I had this idea following this thread with all the cool new local vision models coming out.\n\n",

          "body": "Well. I've managed to put together a worldbuilding engine that can serve as a rather comprehensive lorebook. That was the easy part. \n\nEngineering a way to meaningfully transform data like location data into characters and then into quests that fit these characters... Not a big issue. Figuring out how to organise the database so it stores stuff that makes sense for future use... a bit more problematic. Incl frontend, that was maybe a month of 10hrs a day work, making sure it works down to Qwen 3 0.6b.\n\nThe bigger issue is what you've just asked. Having a GM engine that orchestrates and makes use of it without hallucinating etc while also adhering to the world data you created... Let's just say I have some ideas, but they will only work within my system. \n\nThe moment someone tries creating a universal solution, you will see inconsistencies, hallucinations, Elaras from Ethelgard... It all needs to be tight and somewhat programmatic (as others suggested, some D20s are necessary).\n\nSorry, rambling. But long story short - no, nothing like that truly exists locally. The closest thing is Silly Tavern, but  let's just say ST was the very reason I decided to create my app. There are so many fields you need to fill in that by the time you actually get to interact with it, you wish you just fired up Baldurs Gate 3 or smthg.\n\nMy gut feeling rn is that you can achieve what you want with an agent orchestration framework of sorts. I'm vibecoding, so my choice would be the Lang ecosystem due to its extensive presence in LLM training - you can ask a cloud model to do anything within that framework and it will do extremely well.\n\nHave a look at Langflow.  \n\n// ugh I guess I need to go back to my app, I put it on pause due to getting UI-blinded.",

There's obvious ways to use an AI to enhance things, but if you pare it down to the core, D&D was designed so that Gary Gygax could run his players through yet another dungeon level under the castle, and it plays to the strengths of having a human referee, because he was having fun being the referee.\n\n\nThere's games that have been design to be played solo, and computer RPGs and so on, but I suspect that this is as much a game design problem as it is an AI problem. \n\n\nYou can look at all of the work that AI Dungeon has put in to making their thing work. Not to be discouraging, but to give you ideas for one way to try to solve the problem. \n\n\n\nThis doesn't help with your question, other than to point out that it's a huge ask that goes way beyond the specific model you use.",

With that said, if you find it good or better in anyway than 72b, please let me know so I can give it a try.   qwen3-vl will be great when it gets llama.cpp support, but for now you are better off using qwen2.5-vl 72b at maybe Q6 or even qwen2.5-vl-32b\n\nOne of my tests below\n\nI used this image for a few benchmarks -\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bdhpoic7j6tf1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bfe67d55dd1044929988aaaa1e0e8e5673fbe27\n\n\"Describe this image in great detail\",\n\n\"How many processes are running? count them\",\n\n\"What is the name of the process that is using the most memory?\",\n\n\"What time was the system booted up?\",\n\n\"How long has the system been up?\",\n\n\"What operating system is this?\",\n\n\"What's the current time?\",\n\n\"What's the load average?\",\n\n\"How much memory in MB does this system have?\",\n\n\"Is this a GUI or CLI interface? why?\",",

Sadly every guide I find is about setting this up with Ollama.\n\nDoes anyone know how to do this or of any resources explaining how to set this up?  ",

With four duplications.\n\nThird generation had all valid words, but three duplications.\n\nFourth: Abrace. With two duplications.\n\nAnd Fifth: Abovestairs and Able-bodied. With five duplications.\n\nLetting the model think produced 2/5 correct lists. There were no duplications and the three incorrect generations all had the same mistake: Abrace.\n\nTrying with the list of nonsense words and letting the model think makes the model loop endlessly (adding /nothink makes the model not loop, but you always get some real words), some funny picks from the thinking list:\n\n> 49. Flibbertigibbet (This is a real word, so let's change it to Flibberjibbet)\n\nThe model seemed to like generating this word for some reason. I got it on 3/5 of the /nothink lists. Twice with a similar type of correction.\n\n> **Correction during review:** Upon creating the list, I noticed some words like \"Fandango,\" \"Flummox,\" \"Snark,\" \"Vorpal,\" and \"Slithy\" are either real words or famous nonsense words from literature (like Lewis Carroll's). To provide a truly unique list as requested, I have replaced them and any others I caught with more original creations.\n\n> **Final Self-Correction:** My replacement process was a bit lazy and led to duplicates. A truly fresh list is required. My apologies. Here is the final, carefully curated, duplicate-free list.\n\n> **Final, FINAL Self-Correction:** I see I'm still falling into repetitive patterns and duplicating my own \"made-up\" words. This requires a fresh start. I will generate 100 unique words now, checking each one as I go.\n\nAfter this the model begins to loop very badly:\n\n> Okay, I see the problem. My generation method is flawed and creates loops. Let me do this properly, one by one, ensuring no repeats and no real words.\n\n> I am deeply sorry, my process got stuck in a loop.

      "title": "Crazy idea: Instead of generating 100 tokens in one model, sequentially generate across several models",
      "selftext": "MoE models have a massive underused advantage for consumer hardware over dense models: the VRAM usage is so small you can run several of models(using llama.cpp --cpu-moe I run three models of different quant size: ERNIE, lang-lite, granite. Combined they use less than 8GB VRAM). \n\nSo I had an idea: what if we make proxy server and when it receives \"prompt is 'the screen is blue', make me 100 tokens', instead of doing it, the proxy generates 15-30 tokens calling one model, appends their text to the prompt, calls another model with updated prompt, and does so until all tokens are generated.\n\nI asked gemini-pro a little (too lazy to make myself)  and got  [llama-in-the-middle](https://github.com/Maykeye/llama-in-the-midle) proxy that sits on 11111 port and switches between 10000, 10001, 10002 for /completion(not for chat, it's possible but requires effort). There is no CLI options, gui, all settings are in the python file; requirements.txt not included\n\nThe downside is during a switch there is a pause as model needs to figure out the prompt WTF other models have generated. Inclusion of output of different models makes them creative and less repetitive.\n\n(Also it seems the models are able to recover from different tokenization: models with token \"thinking\" are capable to make \"thinking\" in text if text ends with \"thinki\")\n\nFeel free to steal idea if you are going to make next UI",

Always use mlx models.\n\nObviously more ram would be better but i got the 16gb for 450€ while 24gb would be at least 600-800€ which wasn’t worth it for me. 16gb was the sweet spot between power/ram and costs. Obviously it wont replace chatgpt 100% but for yor use case with emails it will be enough. You could also use something like n8n or dify (i am using dify) to create specific use case related workflows. That way the gemma e4b could probably provide more than enough quality depending on the use case.\n\nKeep in mind that if you use it as a home server in general and not only llm server, there will be less ram for the llm. I am using a n100 mini pc as home server (100€ 2 years ago) and i am satisfied. Would also be cheaper to buy a n100 with 16gb ddr5 for the home sever stuff and a 16gb mac mini than buying a 24gb mac mini.

Apple machines with M series processors can transfer at about 450 gigabytes per second. Transfer rates for high-end tensor processors are terabytes per second.

Basically we need a new model type that actively pulls from the drive while only keeping the \"core\" loaded. So a core has basic prompt processing, checks with the \"table of contents\" that's loaded in the memory and only after that it pulls the corresponding \"chapter\"/expert from the drive and our regular current magic happens. This way you can run 1t model on something like a home setup with 32gb of vram because it would only pull the parts it needs. That's my vision for the future. Perhaps we will have an expert hierarchy in a couple of years, or external expert modules to pull from the cloud or something like that as well. Also actively loading from drive would probably finally make NVME drives and higher PCIE standarts relevant because you'll need to pull quite a lot of GB from the drive. \nP.S. my comment is copyrighted none can steal ideas from it :>  (or so I wished)",

      "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI smoked some really good weed recently and decided it was a good idea to buy more 3090s.\n\nNaturally I didn't want to use a real build with server parts, put 8 3090s in one build on home depot racks? No thanks I'm lazy.\n\nI got 4 3090 egpus from a guy on facebook. He's cool, sold them to me for 650 each with the egpu. \n\n[https://www.gigabyte.com/Graphics-Card/GV-N3090IXEB-24GD](https://www.gigabyte.com/Graphics-Card/GV-N3090IXEB-24GD) <--- these are the EGPUs\n\nThen I got 4 other random 3090s of different brands and put them in 3 spare Pcs I have lying around.\n\nNode #1\n\n* Z390 Prime\n* 9900K\n* 64gb of DDR4\n* 3090 (duh)\n* 850W.\n\nNode #2\n\n* MSI Unify ITX z690\n* 12400K\n* 64gb of DDR5\n* 3090 (duh) \n* 650W\n* 2X 3090 EGPUs attached\n\nNode #3 (Host)\n\n* Z790 Maximus Hero\n* 13700k\n* 64gb of DDR5\n* 1200W PSU\n* 2x 3090s \n* 2x 3090 EGPUs attached\n\nI ran all of it over VLLM with Ray to distribute the load. It's connected over Wifi, I got a good router so speed is about only 10% slower than ethernet from across the house. For now it's all pipeline parallel until the parts arrive then I'll do a 2 node system with 4 gpu each.\n\n[https://rog.asus.com/us/networking/rog-rapture-gt-axe16000-model/](https://rog.asus.com/us/networking/rog-rapture-gt-axe16000-model/) <--- my router(s).\n\nResults:\n\nAt 128k context limit running GLM 4.5 Air AWQ 8 bit (that's Q8 for you gguf folks)\n\nI get 5500 tokens/s prompt processing and 24 tokens a second for a 50k\\~ ish token prompt. \n\nIt works great over Roo.\n\nRay has a very annoying overhead cost so just assume that each system has like 1gb less vram. Running all my node in headless helps alot too.\n\nUpdate: got the parts to put it on two nodes with 4 GPUs each and using TP4 AND PP2. \n\noutputting 65 t/s. Mama mia\n\n",
