      "selftext": "I'm a growth marketer selling to mid market and enterprise. For years we've leaned on classic gated landing pages for every campaign like webinars, calculators, playbooks, etc. lately we're seeing those pages do less and less. \n\nFewer conversions, more dropoffs, it just feels like people don't want to jump through hoops anymore. \n\nWe've been experimenting with making email itself the offer. No clickthrough to a landing page, CTA just opens a pre filled reply or short form in email, and keeping people inside their inbox where they're already primed to act. \n\nAnother team tested this with a client and the email-only flow outperformed the landing page by around 25% on signups. Especially in smaller well defined segments like RevOps leaders at top accounts. \n\nBut we're nervous about losing tracking data and A/B test control that landing pages have. Anyone here make the switch?\n\nIf so, please let me know if: \n\n* It held up past the first few sends\n* How you handled attribution and reporting\n* Any unexpected side effects on deliverablility, spam filters, buyer confusion, etc. ",

          "body": "i did this a lot while building Reddinbox , short answer: yes, but only for tightly targeted segments. tbh we saw +20–30% signups vs gated pages for RevOps/ABM-style lists and that lift held across several months, but it fades if you spray it broadly or reuse the exact CTA too often :)\n\naim to create campaign-specific inboxes or plus-addresses (reply+acct-expansion (at) yourdomain.com), parse replies into your CRM and tag them, or use unique reply-to per A/B cell so every incoming email maps to a variant\n\nA/B by cohort segmentation (not on-page variants) and keep a minimal fallback landing page for complex handoffs. Deliverability-wise it’s fine if you warm the sending domain, avoid spammy subjects, and don’t rely on AMP , expect more manual/qualifying replies and less site behavioral data, so plan instrumentation around email hits and CRM events",

That transparency led to DMs from parents, founders, and investors — which he turned into **25 early hands-on users**.\n\nWhat stood out to me:\n\n* He used every DM and comment like a discovery call\n* Built features *directly* from parent feedback\n* Focused on emotion and identity, not just functionality\n\nHead over to ProofStories for the full story!\n\n",

      "title": "5 Viral Marketing Laws That Actually Grow SaaS Products",
      "selftext": "Most SaaS marketing advice is garbage. Here are the laws that actually work.\n1. Thompson's Law: Mega-Accounts Make Things Viral\nContent doesn't spread person-to-person. One huge account shares it to millions at once.\nAction: Stop trying to get 1,000 people to share. Make a list of 10 mega-accounts in your space. Create content specifically to make them hit repost.\nExample: Notion didn't go viral through word-of-mouth. They got Ali Abdaal (5M+ YouTube subscribers) to make productivity videos featuring Notion. One creator = millions of signups overnight.\n2. Purple Cow Law: Different Gets Shared\nLiquid Death sells water in beer cans with death metal branding. They're worth $1.4B. For water.\nAction: Check your top 5 competitors. Do the exact opposite. Serious industry? Be funny. Corporate language? Talk like a human. Weird wins.\nExample: Gong could've been another boring sales analytics tool. Instead, they use sports betting language and memes. \"Gong or gone\" became a sales culture thing. Now they're a unicorn because they made enterprise software fun.\n3. Anti-Polish Principle: Scrappy Outperforms Studio\nLinkedIn's most viral post ever? A no-makeup selfie. 850K+ likes.\nAction: iPhone videos and behind-the-scenes shots outperform polished content. People want authentic in a world of AI slop.\nExample: SaaS companies spend thousands on polished product demos that no one watches. Meanwhile, a sales rep's 2-minute screen recording explaining one feature gets shared everywhere.  If you need volume, tools like Trupeer turn those raw recordings into clean product demos automatically.\n\n4. Matthew's Advantage: Looking Big Makes You Big\nGong bought 15 seconds of Times Square billboard space for a few hundred dollars. Photographed it. Made it look massive. Amplified everywhere.\nAction: Small ad in prestigious publication > big ad in unknown one. \"As seen in\" badges even if just one sentence mentioned you.\nExample: Superhuman wasn't available to most people for years, but they got featured in every tech publication by being invite-only. \"Waitlist of 180,000 people\" became their marketing. Looking exclusive made them huge before most people could even use it.\n5. Reactance Theory: \"Don't Do This\" Outperforms \"Do This\"\n\"Don't click this ad\" beats \"Click here.\" \"Not for everyone\" creates more demand than \"Perfect for anyone.\"\nAction: Test negative CTAs. Create invite-only content. Use waitlists even when unnecessary. People hate being told what they can't have.\nExample: Superhuman's headline: \"Email for high-performing teams.\" Not \"Email for everyone.\" Clubhouse: \"Invite-only\" when they didn't need to be. The exclusivity created 10x more demand than \"Sign up free today\" ever would.\n\nThese aren't growth hacks. They're psychological laws that worked before the internet and will work after whatever comes next.\nPick one. Test it this week\n",

      "selftext": "After talking to dozens of early-stage founders (and making the same mistakes myself), I’ve noticed a pattern:  \nMost SaaS products don’t die because the market is too crowded.  \nThey die because no one really understands what they do.\n\nHere’s what usually happens:\n\n* Founders explain how it works (“AI-powered analytics dashboard”).\n* Instead of explaining what problem it solves (“so marketers know which campaigns actually drive revenue”).\n* Then users bounce, thinking “looks cool… but not for me.”\n\nHere’s what fixed it for us:\n\n1. One-line clarity test: If a stranger can’t tell who it’s for + what problem it solves in 5 seconds, rewrite it.\n2. Feature detox: Every new feature must tie back to one clear value proposition.\n3. Problem-first landing pages: Lead with pain, not tech. “We help agencies stop guessing client ROI” will always beat “Next-gen analytics AI.”\n\nClarity converts. Confusion kills faster than competition ever could.\n\nCurious, how do you test if your positioning is actually clear to users?",

Tesla has real-world driving data from millions of cars. Chinese companies are ahead in affordable autonomous tech.\n\nEurope is late to this race.

Very sophisticated strategy.\n\n\n\nWe pay £20-30 per video plus a chunky bonus if they hit 1M views. They make separate Auralyze accounts and post 4x a week.\n\n\n\nOne month later: 3M+ views, 5x revenue growth.\n\n\n\nOur best creator gained 2K followers from just 2 videos that both went over 1M views.\n\n\n\nBiggest surprise was that some videos with millions of views barely converted to actual customers. Viral doesn't mean sales apparently.\n\n\n\nAlso 80% of our results came from 20% of our creators which tracks.\n\n\n\nWrote the full breakdown here: [https://angelina.dev/blog/how-we-5xd-revenue-with-micro-influencers](https://angelina.dev/blog/how-we-5xd-revenue-with-micro-influencers)",

How are you running your weekly, bi-weekly or monthly growth meetings?\n\nI’m standing up a growth squad every week. My idea was to use these meetings (with a group of product, data, analytics, PMMs) to analyze the funnel, scorecard, and focus on acquisition, activation, retention, and upgrades. But I’m trying to figure out the how.\n\nHow do you structure the agenda?\n\nWhat metrics or dashboards do you review every time?\n\nDo you use the meeting to brainstorm experiments, or is it more for alignment and accountability?\n\nWhat’s actually worked to make these meetings valuable instead of a status update?\n\nWould love to hear what’s worked for you.",

Find new clients consistently\n2. Package my services for recurring value (like automation maintenance or workflow upgrades\n3. Build something scalable and predictable instead of one-time projects\n\nI’m confident in my skills — I can build any kind of n8n automation or API-based system integration — but I need clarity on how to turn this into a steady MRR-based business.\n\nIf anyone here has experience building a recurring income model as a freelancer or automation expert, I’d really appreciate your advice 🙌\n",

Google and other search engines are still crawling and indexing your site the same way. So, make sure your site is easily crawlable, has a solid structure, and is mobile-friendly. All the usual technical SEO stuff still matters.\n\n\\-Content is important, but Context is critical: High-quality content is still essential. But now, it's even more important to deeply understand your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) and create content that truly resonates with their needs and pain points. Think beyond just keywords. What questions are they really asking? What problems are they desperately trying to solve?\n\n\\- E-E-A-T is even MORE critical: Expertise, Experience, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T) are ranking factors, checkout this paper: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09735](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09735) . With AI search, this becomes even more crucial. Focus on building your reputation as a trusted authority in your niche.\n\nWe built [verbatune.com](http://verbatune.com) to streamline this entire process. It provides you with AI visibility (brand mentions and sentiment) in chatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, etc. combined with deep SEO/AEO analysis based on ICP. Using this information, it generates optimized content that ranks in days.\n\nI think ICP-driven content is where I see things heading.\n\nHappy to chat more about this,  let me know if you have any specific questions!",

      "selftext": "We pride ourselves on being scientists of scale. We build complex models, track every conceivable data point, and speak in the sacred language of LTV and CAC. We've automated our outreach and optimized our funnels to perfection. Yet, in our quest to engineer growth, we often ignore the most fickle variable in the entire equation: human psychology. We're trying to build a logical machine for an illogical species.\n\nThe most significant leak in any sophisticated funnel isn't a technical flaw; it's a moment of subconscious doubt. A user clicks your brilliantly targeted ad, intrigued by the promise of your SaaS platform. Before they even see your pricing page, they check your socials. They find your YouTube demo with 84 views and your Twitter feed filled with crickets. The disconnect is jarring. Your ad promised industry leadership, but your social proof whispers \"unproven startup.\" The user bounces, and your perfect CAC calculation is now a lie.\n\nThe savviest growth teams have quietly started treating this initial credibility gap as the first and most critical touchpoint. It's not a vanity metric; it's the foundation of trust that determines the efficiency of every dollar spent downstream. A base layer of social proof isn't the result of growth, it's the fuel for it. It's what convinces both the platform's algorithm and the user's gut instinct that you're a train worth catching.\n\nThe real hack is operationalizing this. It's a pre-launch ritual, not a reactive measure. I've seen the data from campaigns where the only variable changed was priming the social assets before the media buy went live. The difference in ROAS was staggering. Using a discreet service to generate that initial layer of validation, a provider like Viral Rabbi has been a reliable tool in the kit, doesn't just improve conversions; it fundamentally alters the campaign's trajectory by aligning perception with reality. It's the unspoken first step in any true growth playbook: before you ask for a customer's trust, you have to stage the set to look like you already have it.\n\n",

Those people were active, interested, and way warmer than any cold list. That’s how I booked my first call, then my 10th, then hundreds more.\n\nThe problem: doing it manually took forever. So I built a small tool for myself. It:\n\nPulls leads from competitor comment sections\n\nScrapes from LinkedIn search results\n\nRuns in the browser (no login details needed)\n\nLets you automate LinkedIn tasks so you’re not stuck doing repetitive stuff all day\n\nNot some big “growth hack”, just a way to make the process less painful for a solopreneur like me.\n\nI just started beta testing it.

      "selftext": "So how do I create high-quality content with greater explanation?\n\nFirst, I create all the assets and artifacts in any visual creation app, such as Figma or FigJam.\n\nOnce my visuals are ready, I do a screen recording with the microphone on and talk about the visual itself, navigating it with zooming in and zooming out.\n\nSo the whole visual is a walkthrough with my voice on it, with rough description or rough scripting about what the product is.\n\nOnce this video is ready, I drop this video into Gemini and ask it to extract the transcripts.\n\nThe transcripts would be highlighted with all the things I talked about. Once I have the transcripts already in Gemini, I would ask it to nourish it, make it high quality, more tuned to be fed into an LLM which would be a text-to-speech model.\n\nSo it generates me a high quality transcript with proper texting and outputs around how it should be transcribed.\n\nAnd I take this transcription and put it into HeyGen.\n\nThen I edit a little bit and let HeyGen create the high quality audio. Then I would stitch these two things: the video that I recorded on my device and the audio that I created using HeyGen in any video editing app.\n\nAnd once this is ready, I would export the high quality video recording and the audio overlay and share it on different social media platforms.\n\nWHY THIS WORKS:\n\nYour authentic explanation becomes the foundation\nAI handles the polish, not the creativity\nTotal cost: mostly free tools\nTime investment: 2-3 hours per video\n\nThe democratization of content creation isn’t coming. It’s here.\n\nWhat’s your content creation workflow? Drop it in the comments, always looking to optimize mine.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

Your six-step breakdown shows exactly what most people miss — consistent quality comes from consistent workflow.\n\nWhen I first started making videos, I hit the same wall. The ideas were there, but execution was chaos. Too many tools, too many steps, no structure. I’d lose hours just trying to connect scripts, images, and edits into something coherent.\n\nThat frustration was what made me start building **Verso AI** — a platform meant to turn a creator’s workflow into a semi-automated pipeline from script to image to video.

Dead.\n\nYour customers have been lied to by 10,000 dropshippers, 5,000 “gurus,” and every snake oil salesman on the internet.\n\nThey’re desensitized. They’re skeptical. And they should be.\n\nPeople will pay premium prices.\n\nBut only if what you’re selling is genuinely worth it. They want the best for their buck.\n\nSo give it to them.\n\nStop trying to trick people into buying. It doesn’t scale.\n\n2. Bundle everything if you want to charge premium (instant profit increase, DONE RIGHT)\n\nThis is non-negotiable.\n\nFind things that are low cost to you but high value to them. Then bundle them.\n\nExample: I’m in the furniture business. Instead of just selling furniture, I include free lifetime maintenance, longevity tips, repair instructions.\n\nCosts me close to nothing. Worth a lot to them.\n\nYou ONLY BUNDLE elements that are genuinely going to solve your customer’s biggest problems AFTER purchasing your product.\n\nThat’s how you build trust.\n\nThat’s how you justify premium pricing.\n\n3. Talk like a human at every single touchpoint\n\nYour emails. Your website. Your newsletters. All of it.\n\nWords carry power.\n\nYour brain processes every word in the context of your experiences.\n\nIf you want authentic connections, communicate authentically.\n\nI see businesses write emails like they’re filing legal documents. And heavily relying on AI jargon. If anything, being authentic and being you is gonna help you the most.\n\nWrite like you’re talking to a friend who’s trying to solve a problem. That’s it.\n\n4. You need a social media presence in 2025\n\nI don’t care if you hate filming.\n\nI don’t care if you don’t want to show your face.\n\nYou need to put content out there.\n\nWhy? Because everything is AI garbage now.\n\nReal humans showing their face, their process, their journey—that’s the differentiator.\n\nYou don’t need to be MrBeast. You just need to be real.\n\n5. Know WHERE TO use AI\n\nReal talk: I thought AI would be my productivity savior. Instead it burned me out.\n\nI made everything autonomous. Let AI write everything. And it sucked. Because AI is an assistant, not a replacement.\n\nUse AI for research. For repetitive tasks a 15-year-old could do. For coding.\n\nBut anything requiring your creativity, your experience, your brain—do it yourself.\n\nThe content AI spits out? It’s obvious. And your customers can tell.\n\n6. How to stay good at marketing (forever)\n\nYour customers are seeing 4,000+ ads daily.\n\nThe businesses that win are the ones paying attention to the tiny shifts in behavior, in messaging, in channels.\n\nLearning never stops. If you think you’ve “figured out marketing,” you’re already behind.\n\nI made a breakdown of this with examples on YouTube if you want the full system.\n\nNot dropping the link because I know how Reddit feels about that, but it’s on my profile if you’re interested.\n\nWhat’s the biggest marketing mistake you’re making right now? Let’s talk about it.",

Readers are getting pretty savvy about spotting them and the reviews can be brutal if people feel misled about it being AI created.\n\nThe real issue is you built the product before validating anyone actually wants it. What age group is this for? What's the story about? Who's your target reader? Without knowing that stuff, any marketing advice is just guessing.\n\nHere's what you should actually do:\n\nList it on Amazon KDP because it's free and gets you in front of actual book buyers. Price it cheap like $2.99 to $4.99 since it's your first one and you're unknown. Write a compelling description that focuses on the story itself, not how you made it.\n\nDon't mention it's AI generated in your marketing unless you're specifically targeting people who care about AI creation. Most readers just want a good story and don't give a damn about the process. Our clients who've published books learned that leading with \"I used AI\" tanks interest immediately.\n\nGumroad works if you've got an existing audience but you don't, so that's just another empty storefront. Skip it for now.\n\nSocial media and subreddits could work but you gotta actually be part of those communities first. Dropping a link to your AI book in writing subs will get you roasted or banned. Find communities for your specific genre or age group and engage genuinely before ever mentioning what you made.\n\nThe landing page with ads thing is honestly a waste of money for a book. Nobody's searching for your specific story, and cold traffic to an unknown book by an unknown author converts like crap. Save your money.\n\nReal talk though, one AI generated storybook isn't gonna make you money. The people actually making sales in this space are pumping out dozens of books and building a catalog. One book just sits there with zero visibility on Amazon unless you get lucky or already have an audience.\n\nFocus on making the book actually good instead of worrying about marketing tactics. Get beta readers to tell you if the story even works. If it sucks, no amount of marketing will save it. If it's genuinely good, word of mouth and Amazon's algorithm will do more for you than any ads you could run.",

      "selftext": "**The goal:** Stay one step ahead of rival brands by knowing every creator they partner with and every offer they test.\n\n**The challenge:** Influencer posts disappear fast in endless feeds, making competitive intel fragmentary at best.\n\n**The solution:** Glue together a few free data sources + light automation to put competitor influencer activity into a single living dashboard you can interrogate at any time.\n\n**Why use this approach?**\nInfluencer spend is still the most opaque line item in a marketing P&L. By reverse-engineering what's actually live in the feed—creative angles, CTAs, promo codes—you get early signals on funnels that eventually show up in paid ads months later. Act on those signals first and you win cheaper reach, better CAC, and a reputation for \\\"being everywhere\\\".\n\n**Step 1 — Catch every public post in real time.**\n• Set up a simple Mention + Zapier (or RSS + IFTTT) flow that watches Instagram/TikTok/YouTube for handles, hashtags, and even coupon prefixes your competitors typically use (e.g. \\\"BRAND20\\\").\n• Pipe the raw URLs into a Google Sheet; append timestamp, platform, and creator handle automatically.\n\n**Step 2 — Enrich with performance clues.**\n• Grab view counts & like counts via the free TikTok Creative Center API, YouTube oEmbed, or a lightweight scraper (keep requests low volume to stay TOS-friendly).\n• Add a column that flags spikes in views vs. each creator's baseline—those are the angles resonating.\n\n**Step 3 — Overlay qualitative context.**\n• Once a week, scan G2/Trustpilot reviews for the same competitors; tag recurring pain points (\\\"pricing lock-in\\\", \\\"slow onboarding\\\").\n• Map which pain point each influencer video addresses. Patterns emerge quickly.\n\n**Step 4 — Turn intel into experiments.**\n• Choose one recurring hook (say, \\\"cancel anytime\\\") + one creator archetype (micro-tech reviewers with <50 k following).\n• Launch a 10-creator micro-test using any self-serve platform (I dog-food Marz for this, but manual outreach works too). Keep budget tight, CPM-based, and measure CAC/ROAS within a week.\n\n**Step 5 — Rinse, scale, and iterate.**\n• If a hook beats your control CAC by >20%, double down: brief 50 more creators, raise spend, and roll the angle into your paid social.\n• If it flops, kill fast—your dashboard already has the next three insights queued.\n\nDoing this for a single competitor takes ~30 min to set up and <10 min a week to maintain. After a month you'll have a living map of the whole category's influencer playbook, ready to clone or counter-position.\n\nHope this helps anyone feeling left in the dark on influencer intel—happy to dig deeper into the sheets, APIs, or attribution if useful.",

My goal is to get the first 1,000 users on a $0 budget, but my initial attempts to get traction have all failed.\n\nHere’s the data so far: Direct promotion on app-specific subreddits was ignored and downvoted. A story-driven post about my \"system\" on got massive engagement but was removed for breaking self-promo rules once I shared the app name. A Product Hunt launch also flopped because I had no existing audience to activate.\n\nThe only positive signal was the \"story\" angle, but the distribution channel failed.

How would you leverage that one successful test without getting banned, and what's the most efficient growth experiment I should run from here?\n\nMy app is a personal system I created to turn my screen time guilt into something productive. Essentially, I have to earn every minute I spend on social media or browsing by correctly answering questions from educational quizzes on topics like science, history, and math. To make it feel less like a chore, I built in game-like features, such as daily challenges and streaks that provide big time bonuses for consistency. The system even provides explanations for the answers, so I'm actually learning instead of just guessing. I also added an honor-based component where I reward myself with time for doing positive real-world activities, like reading or stretching. I'm here for strategy, not just clicks.

          "body": "The reality is your app solves a problem most people don't think they have. \"Screen time guilt\" isn't a pain point the average person is actively seeking solutions for, which is why your direct promotion flopped.\n\nThe story angle worked because you made it relatable, but here's the issue: you can't scale storytelling without an audience, and building an audience takes months of consistent content creation. That's not a quick path to 1,000 users.\n\nHere's what I'd actually recommend:\n\nPartner with study/productivity YouTubers or TikTokers who have engaged audiences. Offer them early access and ask if they'd genuinely review it. Don't pay them, but make it easy by giving them talking points. Micro-influencers with 10k to 50k followers in the study/productivity space are your best shot because their audiences actually care about this type of tool.\n\nPost in r/productivity, r/getdisciplined, or r/study communities, but lead with the problem and your personal story first. Don't mention the app until people ask. Our clients who do this get way better engagement than leading with \"I made an app.\"\n\nThe school angle could work but you're a solo dev with no credibility or case studies. Teachers aren't gonna recommend your app to students without serious vetting. Save that for later once you have real users and testimonials.\n\nOne thing I gotta mention though: the framing around \"earning\" screen time and turning guilt into productivity could reinforce pretty unhealthy relationships with technology for some people. Like the idea that you need to prove you're productive enough to deserve using your own phone. That might resonate with you personally, but be careful about positioning it that way broadly because it could feed into anxiety or obsessive patterns for others. Consider framing it more as \"optional challenge mode for learning\" rather than something people need to do to justify their screen time.\n\nAlso, Android-only kills your addressable market. iOS users are generally more willing to try new apps and have higher spending power if you ever monetize. That's a real limitation for growth.\n\nThe $0 budget thing means you're grinding community building and organic content for months before seeing real traction. There's no hack around that. Most successful apps either had budget for ads, an existing audience, or a problem so painful people actively searched for solutions. You've got none of those, so it's gonna be slow.\n\nGot it, I'll avoid using \"brutal\" in future responses.",

      "title": "We Finally Cracked App Engagement After Onboarding. Here's What Worked (And What Didn’t)",
      "selftext": "Most posts I see about app success focus on user acquisition getting installs. But what happens after that? We went deep into the black hole of user engagement, especially during that fragile onboarding window. Spoiler: it’s not just about push notifications.\n\nHere’s what we learned from the trenches:\n\n**Onboarding vs Onboarded Engagement**\n\nWe split users into two groups:\n\n* **Onboarding users** (first-timers): First 3-5 seconds matter *a lot*. We focused on getting them to their first \"aha!\" moment ASAP.\n* **Onboarded users** (returning): These folks needed nudges to explore more features, not get bombarded.\n\n**Behavior-Driven Design**\n\nInstead of selling the *product*, we tried changing behavior by converting **external triggers → internal triggers**.\n\nWe built our own “Pinterest moment” one key feature that makes users go: “Yep, I need this.”\n\n**Metrics That Actually Matter**\n\nEveryone obsesses over DAU/MAU. Instead, we tracked:\n\n* **Session length** – How long do they *actually* stay?\n* **Exit rate** – Where are they dropping off?\n* **CTR** – Is our onboarding CTA doing anything?\n* **Email open rate** – Are those welcome emails even being seen?\n\n(We ignored push notification metrics — high numbers here can be misleading unless you track *conversion*, not just volume.)\n\n**What Tools We Used (and Avoided)**\n\n**Use These:**\n\n* **SendinBlue** – Simple, scalable for emails + SMS. Good for personalization.\n* **Braze** – Absolute beast for in-app messaging, onboarding flows, gamification.\n\n**Avoid These (for mobile apps):**\n\n* **Mailchimp** – Great early on, then hits a wall.\n* **HubSpot/Salesforce** – Solid for B2B, terrible for consumer mobile apps.\n* **DIY solutions** – We wasted months trying to “build our own” toolset. Just don’t.\n\nOur best engagement happened *within the first 24 hours*. We pinged users with:\n\n* Welcome email\n* App message walkthroughs\n* Strategic push notifications\n* Support content\n* Deep links to features\n\nThink ping-pong — if the ball doesn’t come back, you re-engage fast or lose them.\n\nWe focused on ONE core feature during onboarding. That clarity reduced churn by 18%. (Trying to show off all features at once killed us early on.)\n\nTake a cue from Gmail — they led with unlimited storage. The rest came later.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n* Engagement ≠ Retention. Treat onboarding as its own beast.\n* Early communication + behavioral hooks are everything.\n* Right tools > building your own.\n* Keep onboarding simple. One feature, one goal.\n* Don’t be fooled by vanity metrics.",

If someone hasn’t hit the event in 10 minutes, swap a tooltip on the key screen instead of a push. Every message gets a deep link straight into the action. Cadence: instant welcome + 1 tip, T+2h in-app nudge, T+20h recap email showing progress and one next step. Hide secondary tabs until activation to reduce wandering, and keep the paywall after activation.\n\nTrack time-to-value, activation rate, and the exact last screen before drop-off; run control groups so pushes don’t fake “engagement.” We used Braze for journeys and Amplitude for paths; DreamFactory helped expose user progress and feature-flag APIs fast without a custom backend lift.

Not required — you can do it manually with a spreadsheet, but it saved me a lot of digging.\n\nCurious: has anyone else tried reviving their worst posts instead of just chasing new ideas? Did it work, or did the algorithm punish repeats?",

      "selftext": "Not a sexy growth hack but wanted to share what actually worked for us since most \"growth hacking\" content focuses on acquisition tricks instead of keeping the customers you already have.\n\nWe're a DTC brand in the health and wellness space doing about $500k annually. Our customer LTV was stuck around $85 for over a year despite trying different ad creatives, landing pages, conversion optimization, and all the usual CRO tactics everyone talks about.\n\nThe breakthrough came when we stopped trying to optimize our way to more new customers and started focusing on the customers we already had. This probably sounds obvious but it took us way too long to actually try it.\n\nHere's what we did, step by step:\n\nMonth 1-2: Basic Email Automation Set up proper email sequences beyond just the welcome email. Post-purchase follow-ups asking how people liked their products, educational content about how to get better results, re-engagement campaigns for people who hadn't bought in 90+ days. Nothing fancy, just consistent communication that wasn't always trying to sell something.\n\nMonth 3-4: Smarter Product Recommendations Instead of randomly suggesting products or just pushing best-sellers, we started recommending based on what people actually bought. If someone bought our sleep supplement, they got content and offers related to better sleep, not random wellness products.\n\nMonth 5-6: Customer Feedback Integration Started actually reading and responding to customer reviews and emails instead of just collecting them. Discovered that people loved certain products for reasons we weren't emphasizing in our marketing.\n\nGot a lot of these ideas from following Joseph Siegel on Twitter (@ecom_joseph). His content about focusing on customer success first really changed how we think about retention. Instead of just trying to sell more, we focused on helping people get results with what they already bought.\n\nResults: Customer LTV jumped from $85 to $162 over six months. Revenue stayed roughly the same because we were spending less on ads, but margins improved dramatically since we weren't paying acquisition costs for every single sale.\n\nThe biggest takeaway: sometimes the boring, obvious stuff works way better than trying to find some secret growth channel or viral marketing trick",

The \"growth hack\" in your title is literally just using better looking emails, which isn't a hack, it's basic email marketing that everyone already knows matters.\n\nThe actual problem you're solving is real though. Supabase auth emails do look like crap and setting up proper transactional email infrastructure is annoying as hell for early stage teams. But you're overselling the AI angle. Describing a workflow in plain English and having it generate an email template isn't revolutionary, that's basically what Loops, Resend, and a dozen other tools already do with slightly different UX.\n\nThe one click Supabase connection could be valuable if it actually handles all the webhook setup and database triggers automatically. That's the tedious part that takes time. But if your AI is just generating email templates based on descriptions, you're not really saving that much time compared to existing tools.\n\nHere's the real test. Can someone who's never touched SendGrid or Postmark go from zero to production ready transactional emails in actually 10 minutes like your title claims? Because our clients who've tried similar tools usually hit snags with DNS setup, deliverability configuration, or webhook debugging that blow past that timeframe fast.\n\nThe other issue is you're targeting a pretty narrow audience. Supabase users who need transactional emails but don't want to use existing email services. That market might be too small unless you expand to other backend platforms quickly.\n\nIf you wanna get real feedback instead of promotional comments, show a video of the actual setup process from scratch. Let people see where it actually saves time versus where it's just moving complexity around. The skepticism you asked for is that AI email generation has been done to death, you gotta prove the Supabase integration is seamless enough to matter.",

          "body": "Growth hacks aren't gonna save you in accounting SaaS. That market is brutal and dominated by players with massive budgets and decades of trust. QuickBooks, Xero, FreshBooks already own the space and switching costs for accounting software are insanely high because nobody wants to mess with their books.\n\nYour real problem isn't finding growth tactics, it's that you're trying to compete in a crowded horizontal market without a clear wedge. Accounting for everyone is accounting for no one. You gotta go way narrower than just \"hyper specific niches\" as a vague idea.\n\nHere's what actually works for our clients in crowded SaaS markets. Pick one industry vertical where the existing tools suck for their specific needs. Not just small businesses in general, but like e-commerce sellers on Shopify dealing with multi-currency inventory, or construction contractors managing progress billing. Build features that solve their exact pain points that QuickBooks doesn't handle well.\n\nThen go all in on that vertical. Join their industry associations, sponsor their conferences, answer questions in their Facebook groups and subreddits. Write content about their specific accounting problems, not generic small business accounting advice. When someone searches \"accounting software for Shopify sellers\" or \"construction accounting software,\" you better be ranking there.\n\nPartnerships can work but not the way you're probably thinking. Don't try to partner with other accounting tools or generic business software. Partner with vertical specific tools your target customers already use. If you're going after e-commerce, integrate deeply with Shopify, WooCommerce, inventory management systems. Make it stupid easy to get data flowing between their existing stack and your tool.\n\nContent is worthless unless it's solving real search intent for your specific niche. Our customers who try broad content strategies in competitive markets get crushed. The ones who write comprehensive guides for one specific audience actually get traction.\n\nStop thinking about growth hacks and start thinking about who has the most painful accounting problems that existing tools ignore. That's your only shot at breaking into this market.",

      "selftext": "When I stepped into leadership, I thought my job was having all the answers.  \nAnd yes, I was wrong.  \nMy real job was to distil vague executive briefs into actionable tasks that my team could actually execute.\n\nYou know the briefs:  \n\"Improve customer engagement\"  \n\"Optimize our processes\"  \n\"Drive innovation\"\n\nCool. WHAT does that mean? By WHEN?\n\nI was drowning until I noticed: Leaders who \"get it\" faster aren't smarter. They ask questions differently.\n\nThen I studied Nikhil Kamat, who does 5+ hour podcasts people actually want to listen to. I stole three techniques:\n\n1. Context Before Questions  \nBad: \"What's the timeline?\"  \nBetter: \"Given our Q4 capacity and last quarter's approval bottleneck, what's realistic here?\"  \nThis way it seems we're collaborating, not interrogating.\n\n2. Ask for Specificity\n\nWhen your CMO says \"drive growth,\" that's a horoscope, not a brief.  \nMy move: \"Are we talking new customer acquisition, higher order value, or better retention? Which is the North Star?\"  \nSuddenly, we're not guessing.\n\n3. Summarize to Create Alignment  \nAfter any dense conversation: \"Just to confirm, we're prioritising X over Y, measuring by Z, deadline is here. Did I miss anything?\"\n\nThe Real Lesson:  \nThe best leaders don't wait for perfect briefs. They actively shape clarity through better questions.\n\nTry this in your next meeting.

You're paying for visual workflows you'll never use to their full potential.\n\n⭕️ Question your requirements. Who actually needs complex automation builders? Not 90% of Solopreneurs.\n\nSo, here's how I do it. The key pieces of the puzzle:\n1. Composio - Connects to Gmail/email platforms without complex OAuth setup.\n2. CSV Files - Your prospect data in simple spreadsheet format\n3. Python Scripting - Simple automation that AI tools like Cursor can help you write\n\n👉 Delete what you can. Cut out the middleman platforms entirely.\n\nInstead of paying ~$200+/month across multiple platforms (Mailchimp, Klaviyo, Zapier, make.com, n8n) for features you'll never use.\n\nYou automate yourself and get:\n- Complete control over your prospect data\n- No subscriber limits or restrictions\n- Custom branding and messaging\n- Direct Gmail integration\n- One-time personal setup\n\nMy automation handles everything:\n- Reads active prospects from your CSV file\n- Sends personalized outreach sequences via Composio\n- Tracks engagement and delivery status\n- Updates CSV records automatically\n- Runs continuously until the campaign is complete\n\n✨ Three tools. One script. 2 hours setup. Done. ✅ \n\nMy process:\n1. Log in to Composio account (it's free)\n2. Connect Gmail through the Composio dashboard\n3. Export your prospect data from Supabase in CSV format\n4. Write the automation script (AI can help with coding i.e. Cursor)\n5. Run GTM campaign automatically\n\nProfessional GTM automation that costs 100% less and gives you complete ownership of your prospect data and workflows is priceless.\n\nThis scales with your business without scaling your costs and without the complexity tax.\n",

      "selftext": "**The goal:** Stay one step ahead of rival brands by knowing every creator they partner with and every offer they test.\n\n**The challenge:** Influencer posts disappear fast in endless feeds, making competitive intel fragmentary at best.\n\n**The solution:** Glue together a few free data sources + light automation to put competitor influencer activity into a single living dashboard you can interrogate at any time.\n\n**Why use this approach?**\nInfluencer spend is still the most opaque line item in a marketing P&L. By reverse-engineering what's actually live in the feed—creative angles, CTAs, promo codes—you get early signals on funnels that eventually show up in paid ads months later. Act on those signals first and you win cheaper reach, better CAC, and a reputation for \"being everywhere\".\n\n**Step 1 — Catch every public post in real time.**\n• Set up a simple Mention + Zapier (or RSS + IFTTT) flow that watches Instagram/TikTok/YouTube for handles, hashtags, and even coupon prefixes your competitors typically use (e.g. \"BRAND20\").\n• Pipe the raw URLs into a Google Sheet; append timestamp, platform, and creator handle automatically.\n\n**Step 2 — Enrich with performance clues.**\n• Grab view counts & like counts via the free TikTok Creative Center API, YouTube oEmbed, or a lightweight scraper (keep requests low volume to stay TOS-friendly).\n• Add a column that flags spikes in views vs. each creator's baseline—those are the angles resonating.\n\n**Step 3 — Overlay qualitative context.**\n• Once a week, scan G2/Trustpilot reviews for the same competitors; tag recurring pain points (\"pricing lock-in\", \"slow onboarding\").\n• Map which pain point each influencer video addresses. Patterns emerge quickly.\n\n**Step 4 — Turn intel into experiments.**\n• Choose one recurring hook (say, \"cancel anytime\") + one creator archetype (micro-tech reviewers with <50 k following).\n• Launch a 10-creator micro-test using any self-serve platform (I dog-food Marz for this, but manual outreach works too). Keep budget tight, CPM-based, and measure CAC/ROAS within a week.\n\n**Step 5 — Rinse, scale, and iterate.**\n• If a hook beats your control CAC by >20 %, double down: brief 50 more creators, raise spend, and roll the angle into your paid social.\n• If it flops, kill fast—your dashboard already has the next three insights queued.\n\nDoing this for a single competitor takes ~30 min to set up and <10 min a week to maintain. After a month you'll have a living map of the whole category's influencer playbook, ready to clone or counter-position.\n\nHope this helps anyone feeling left in the dark on influencer intel—happy to dig deeper into the sheets, APIs, or attribution if useful.",

Part of my job is building awareness in spaces like this one, and honestly. I’m at a bit of ~~frustrated~~ a crossroads.\n\nOn my desk right now, there’s a mountain of content: case studies with real numbers, how-to guides & ebooks, benchmark research, use cases from campaigns that actually worked, educational breakdowns of trends & tactics and tooooons of content with ecomm insights. All of it is “good” on paper. But here’s the thing: I don’t want to just *push content* for the sake of activity. I don’t want to waste anyone’s time or flood the subreddit with stuff people scroll past (because I’m sick of it myself). So I’d rather figure out what this community genuinely values and deliver on that.\n\nSo I’m asking you straight up:What type of martech content do you *actually stop and read*?What do you wish there was *more of* (or less of)?When was the last time you read a post or article here and thought, “damn, that was actually useful”?\n\nNot fishing for promotion here, but genuinely trying to understand what matters to practitioners like you so I can create something really valuable at my own.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts.\n\n",

          "body": "This isn't really an experiment, it's just basic marketing attribution that every serious company does. Capturing UTM parameters and referrer data is Marketing 101, not some breakthrough approach.\n\nThe real problem with form attribution isn't capturing the UTM tags, it's that most buyer journeys are way messier than a single touchpoint. Someone might see your LinkedIn ad, ignore it, then google you three weeks later, read five blog posts, and finally submit a form. If you're only tracking last touch attribution from UTMs, you're giving all the credit to organic search when LinkedIn actually started the journey.\n\nOur clients who do attribution right use tools like HubSpot, Segment, or even just Google Analytics 4 with proper event tracking to capture the full journey across sessions. You need cross device tracking, multi touch attribution models, and integration with your CRM to actually understand what's driving conversions. Just knowing \"40 came from SEO\" doesn't tell you which SEO content or keywords drove those leads or whether they actually convert to customers.\n\nThe other thing is UTM parameters only work if your team actually uses them consistently. Most companies have half their campaigns tagged properly and half with missing or broken UTMs. Then your attribution data is garbage and you're making decisions based on incomplete information.\n\nIf you really wanna improve lead attribution, track view through conversions not just click throughs, implement proper multi touch modeling instead of last click, and connect form submissions all the way through to closed revenue so you know which channels actually drive customers not just leads. Our customers who only optimize for form fills without tracking downstream conversion end up doubling down on channels that generate crap leads.\n\nTools like Attributer or Ruler Analytics handle this stuff automatically if you don't wanna build it yourself. Way better than manually capturing UTMs which is honestly the bare minimum you should've been doing from day one.",

It’s that form data still lives in isolation from what happens next, when the lead becomes an opportunity, goes through the pipeline, or converts to revenue.\n\nSo you can tell “where leads came from,” but not “what actually worked” in terms of revenue/pipeline impact. For example, 30 PPC leads might look great on paper, but if 80% never convert, your budget decisions can still be wrong.\n\nThe sweet spot (and also the hardest part) is connecting those captured UTMs and journeys back to CRM data, so you can see how channels perform not only on volume but also on pipeline and closed-won.

The whole \"growth hack\" framing for basic team coordination stuff is overselling what you're actually describing.\n\nUsing a company page as your hub and having employees share from personal profiles isn't a growth hack, that's just basic LinkedIn strategy that every B2B company figured out five years ago. Same with scheduling tools, that's standard operating procedure not some breakthrough.\n\nHere's what actually moves the needle for LinkedIn growth that our clients have tested. Stop treating LinkedIn like a broadcast channel and start using it for actual conversations. The algorithm rewards genuine engagement way more than scheduled posts. Have your team spend 20 minutes a day commenting meaningfully on prospects' and industry leaders' posts before you worry about your own content calendar.\n\nSecond thing, employee advocacy only works if your team actually wants to share your stuff. Most companies force this and it shows. The posts get zero engagement because they're obviously corporate mandated shares. Let people share when something genuinely resonates with them instead of making it a requirement.\n\nThe personal profile amplification strategy works best when team members are creating their own content about industry topics, not just resharing company posts. Our customers see way better results when their salespeople and executives build their own followings by posting original takes and insights. Then occasionally they mention the company product naturally when relevant.\n\nSales Navigator and automation tools like We-Connect can get your accounts flagged or banned if you're not careful. LinkedIn cracks down hard on automated outreach that looks spammy. If you're gonna automate, keep volumes low and personalization high or you'll burn through accounts fast.\n\nThe real growth hack nobody wants to hear is that LinkedIn success takes consistent effort over months, not clever tactics. Post valuable content regularly, engage authentically with your network, and stop looking for shortcuts.",

They're too close to the features and can't articulate the outcome. That's why your landing page feels like random dots, you're probably listing what your product is instead of what problem it solves and why someone should care.\n\nAI tools like ChatGPT are garbage for landing page copy because they give you generic fluff that sounds professional but says nothing. \"Streamline your workflow\" and \"boost productivity\" type bullshit that every SaaS says. The output lacks specificity because the AI doesn't know your customers' actual pain points or the language they use to describe their problems.\n\nHere's what our clients struggle with most. They can't write copy that resonates because they haven't talked to enough customers. The best landing page copy comes from literally transcribing how your best customers describe their problem and your solution. If you don't have those customer interviews recorded, you're just guessing at what matters to people.\n\nThe second issue is positioning. Most SaaS founders try to be everything to everyone in their copy. \"Perfect for agencies, freelancers, enterprises, and small businesses\" means it's actually for nobody. Pick one audience and write specifically for them. Your copy will instantly get better.\n\nAI tools can help with structure and variations once you know what you're trying to say, but they can't figure out your positioning or value prop for you. That requires actual customer research and clear strategic thinking about who you serve and why you're different.\n\nStop looking for tools to fix your copy problem. Go talk to ten customers about why they bought and what problem you solved. Record those calls. Your landing page will write itself from those conversations.",

The numbers you're claiming don't pass the smell test honestly.\n\n3% of cold Instagram DMs converting to paying clients is either total bullshit or you're selling something that costs like 50 bucks. There's no way you're closing 90 real clients per month from cold DMs unless your offer is dirt cheap or you're counting consultations as \"clients\" instead of actual paid customers.\n\nThe bigger problem is you're admitting to using automation tools across 6 Instagram accounts which violates Instagram's TOS. Meta cracks down hard on this and you're gonna wake up one day with all those accounts banned. Our clients who tried scaling Instagram automation always end up losing accounts, it's not a matter of if but when.\n\nCold DMs can work but not at the scale and conversion rates you're claiming. The math doesn't add up. If you're really closing 90 clients monthly from DMs, you'd be doing multiple millions in revenue and wouldn't be posting guides on Reddit.\n\nHere's what actually works for Instagram outreach without getting banned. Use one or two accounts max, keep volumes low like 30 to 50 DMs per day, and personalize every single message based on the person's actual content. Comment on their posts first to warm them up. Build real relationships instead of spraying thousands of automated messages.\n\nThe \"laser targeted prospecting\" and \"personalized messages\" claims are contradicted by the fact that you're sending 3000 DMs per month with automation. That's not personalized, that's scaled spam with maybe their name dropped in. Our customers who do genuine personalized outreach send way fewer messages but get much higher quality responses and actual conversions.\n\nStop selling the dream of automated clients and be real about what this actually is, which is high volume low conversion outreach that risks account bans.",

First, the accounts must be properly warmed up. Also, tools with anti-detection browsers should be used, and each account should operate under a different IP address.\n\nConversion rates can be even better than this — it depends on how you generate leads. If you have a strong offer for the market and you target leads from the comments section of posts that are relevant to what you’re selling, then you're reaching highly valuable and qualified leads.\n\nFinally, sending thousands of messages isn't about converting them all into customers. Rather, it’s a way to quickly filter and identify the highest number of potential customers and expose your product to as many qualified prospects as possible",

          "body": "The NugVerse and Aspire mentions make this feel like a soft pitch but the core insight is legit. UGC does typically outperform polished brand content in paid social, especially for DTC brands.\n\nThe reason isn't just that it looks more authentic, it's that UGC gives people permission to want your product without feeling sold to. Polished brand content triggers people's ad blindness, UGC looks like something their friend would post. The engagement and conversion lift you're seeing is pretty standard when you make that switch.\n\nHere's what you're not mentioning though. UGC quality varies like crazy and most brands end up with a bunch of mediocre content from creators who don't actually use the product or understand the audience. The real work isn't finding creators through a platform, it's briefing them properly so they create content that actually converts instead of just getting likes.\n\nOur clients who crush it with UGC do a few things differently. They give creators way more freedom than most brands are comfortable with. Rigid briefs kill authenticity. They also test like 20 different pieces of UGC to find the 2 or 3 that actually drive conversions, not just engagement. High engagement doesn't always equal sales, especially if the content is entertaining but doesn't communicate your value prop clearly.\n\nThe other thing is your CAC improvement probably came from both the creative switch and better targeting. If you refined your demo when picking creators, you likely also tightened your ad targeting which drives efficiency gains independent of the creative format.\n\nFor anyone testing this, don't just swap all your ads to UGC overnight. Run split tests between your best branded content and UGC with identical targeting. Our customers often find that certain product categories or customer segments still respond better to polished content. It's not one size fits all even though UGC is having a moment right now.",

One thing that really changed everything for me was focusing on building genuine relationships in communities where your ideal clients are already hanging out and asking questions. Instead of posting about your agency, start answering technical questions in places like r/entrepreneur or r/startups where founders are struggling with website issues. When someone asks \"how do I build a dashboard for my SaaS\" you can give them a detailed helpful answer and naturally mention you've built similar systems. The key is being genuinely helpful first and letting people discover you're available for hire through your expertise, not through direct promotion.\n\nAlso since I help organize OGTool, I've seen how powerful consistent valuable content can be when you're patient with it and focus on solving real problems people are posting about every day.",

You’ve already shown you can deliver, which is half the battle. Right now it’s less about your coding chops and more about how you put yourself out there. A few things I’ve seen work from experience:  \n  \n\\- Don’t sell yourself as “just a developer.” Say something like “I build lean full-stack sites for early-stage founders who can’t hire a big team yet.” That positioning sticks way better.  \n– Hang where your buyers hang. Shouting into the void on random platforms is like fishing in an empty pond. Instead, be active on IndieHackers, LinkedIn founder groups, even startup subs. That’s where your prospects are actually scrolling.  \n– Don’t just post “I built a site.” Show receipts. Break it down to “here’s how I cut load time by 40%” or “here’s the admin panel workflow I designed.” People love seeing how the sausage gets made.  \n– Quality > quantity in outreach. Spray-and-pray DMs usually get you ghosted. But if you drop a line like, “Hey, noticed your onboarding feels clunky, and I’ve fixed this for a founder before, here’s what worked”, suddenly you’re not spamming, you’re helping.  \n  \nYou’re not starting from scratch, lah. You’ve got proof you can ship. Now it’s about tightening the focus and playing where it counts. Keep at it man, consistency compounds.",

          "body": "Your technical skills are solid but your marketing is completely wrong. Posting about your agency on social media and hoping clients find you doesn't work.\n\nHere's what to actually do:\n\nGo where early-stage founders hang out: Indie Hackers, startup subreddits, founder Discord servers. Don't post \"I'm available for hire.\" Help people with technical questions for free, show you know your shit, and when someone mentions needing dev work, offer your services.\n\nUse your testimonial strategically. Find people building similar products and message them directly: \"I built X for \\[client\\] who had this exact problem, here's the video testimonial, want to discuss your project?\" Way more effective than posting into the void.\n\nCold outreach works if done right. The \"decrease my reach\" worry is honestly overthinking it. Your reach doesn't matter if it's not converting anyway. Find 20 founders building web apps, understand what they're making, send personalized messages about how you could help their specific project.\n\nFor immediate money, take smaller gigs on Upwork or Fiverr while building your pipeline. Yeah the rates are lower but it's income while you're finding direct clients. Our clients who freelance successfully usually start with platforms then transition to direct relationships.\n\nDrop the \"Aurora Studio\" agency branding. Founders hiring for ₹90k projects don't care about your agency name, they care if you can build what they need. Just be \"I'm a full-stack developer who builds X.\"\n\nBe realistic about your family's financial situation. Freelance income is unpredictable, especially early on. You might go months between clients. If your family needs steady income right now, consider stable part-time remote work while building your client base.\n\nFor your health, manage stress properly. The pressure of needing money with no clients is intense and not good for your heart. Be strategic about where you put energy instead of scattered efforts.\n\nYour next steps this week: help people for free in founder communities, reach out directly to 20 founders about their projects, sign up for one freelance platform as backup, stop posting generic \"hire me\" content.\n\nThe 4 years learning weren't wasted. Marketing is just a different skill than programming and most developers suck at it. You gotta shift from \"build it and they'll come\" to actively finding people who need what you build.",

The only headache for me is that I’m in country where Shopify Payments/Stripe don’t work.\n\nI’ve tried different setups (LLCs, LTDs abroad), but every time I try to scale my own stores past \\~$1k, the payment processors shut me down. That’s when I started working with clients in supported countries instead, and it’s been smooth. Across those stores, we’ve done over $500k in sales. The last client’s store I managed did $30k in Jan alone.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nr7yk0w0vhsf1.png?width=1148&format=png&auto=webp&s=50db9797e7112bed3b3df09f7028ce22750fea43\n\nThis month I wanted to test again with my own UK LTD store.

I’ll take care of everything hands-on — product research, custom CRO-focused store, creatives, ad strategy, fulfillment (through my private agent), and scaling.\n\nI know how to build brands, test fresh angles, and scale with new avatars. The only thing holding me back is payments.\n\nIf you’re serious about building a DTC brand this Q4, let’s talk.\n\nI know posts like this attract skepticism. That’s fair. Happy to jump on a Zoom call and show proof of past work before anyone commits. We’ll work with explicit terms: you remain legal owner, I run and scale the business.

      "title": "The Unseen Friction in Your Funnel",
      "selftext": "We spend countless hours optimizing our funnels, A/B testing landing pages, and refining our ad copy to perfection. We track every click and conversion with surgical precision, believing the path to growth is paved with better data and smoother user journeys. Yet, we often miss the most significant point of friction, and it exists long before a user ever sees our landing page. It's the moment a potential customer encounters our brand in the wild on a social platform and makes a subconscious judgment based on a single metric: social consensus.\n\nA brilliantly targeted ad might drive a user to your company's Twitter profile, but if your most recent thread has one like, the credibility you paid for evaporates instantly. You can have the most sophisticated referral program ever coded, but if the YouTube video explaining it has 14 views, it looks like a ghost town, not a movement. This isn't a funnel problem; it's a social proof problem that actively undermines every acquisition dollar you spend. The modern customer journey doesn't start at the ad click; it starts with the social validation they encounter before they commit to that click.\n\nThe most effective growth hacks now involve pre-qualifying these social touchpoints. It’s about ensuring that every point of contact between your brand and a potential user signals activity and validation. This isn’t about inflating vanity metrics; it’s about removing the invisible friction that causes prospects to bounce before they even enter your carefully constructed funnel. By staging these social assets to look established and engaging, you dramatically increase the conversion efficiency of your entire marketing stack.\n\nThis requires a proactive approach to seeding engagement. For a recent project, the key to unlocking our paid acquisition channels was to first ensure our core social content was primed for conversion. Leveraging a service to generate a realistic baseline of engagement on these assets was the catalyst. Using a provider like Viral Rabbi to create that foundational layer of social proof meant that the traffic we paid for arrived with higher intent and trust. This single step lowered our overall customer acquisition cost and, more importantly, activated organic sharing by making our brand look like one that was already winning. Sometimes the most powerful growth lever is simply making your brand look like it doesn't need one.\n\n",

          "body": "This is just a long winded pitch for buying fake engagement and you're trying to dress it up as strategic thinking. Let's be real about what you're actually suggesting here.\n\nBuying engagement from services like Viral Rabbi to create \"social proof\" is fake growth that'll bite you in the ass long term. Yeah, having 14 views on your explainer video looks bad, but the solution isn't to artificially inflate it with purchased engagement. The solution is to actually build an audience that gives a damn about what you're doing.\n\nHere's why this strategy is crap. First, platforms are getting better at detecting fake engagement and will throttle your organic reach when they catch it. Our clients who tried buying engagement to jumpstart their social presence ended up with worse algorithmic performance than if they'd just grown organically from zero.\n\nSecond, fake social proof doesn't convert because it's not targeting your actual audience. Sure, your tweet might have 100 likes now instead of 1, but if none of those people are potential customers, you're just fooling yourself. The person who clicks through from your ad can still tell your engagement is hollow when they scroll your timeline and see zero meaningful conversations happening.\n\nThird, you're optimizing for the wrong problem. If people are bouncing after checking your social profiles, the issue isn't low engagement numbers, it's that your content sucks or doesn't clearly communicate what you do. Fix your positioning and content quality instead of papering over it with purchased metrics.\n\nReal social proof comes from actually having customers and users who engage with your stuff. If you don't have that yet, lean into being early and transparent about building in public. Our customers who authentically document their journey from zero get way more trust than ones who fake looking established.\n\nStop selling people on shortcuts that don't work and will damage their brand credibility when people figure out the engagement is fake.",

          "body": "Events as a growth channel are honestly hit or miss, and you're right that most are just noise. The ROI from events comes from being strategic about which ones you attend and how you work them, not from showing up and hoping something happens.\n\nHere's what our clients who actually get deals from events do differently:\n\nThey pick events based on where their ideal customers are concentrated, not where other founders are networking. A fintech startup going to fintech industry conferences crushes it. That same startup going to generic startup events wastes time talking to people who can't buy from them.\n\nPre-event outreach is where most of the value gets created. They identify 10-20 target prospects who'll be there, reach out before the event saying \"I'll be at X conference, would love to grab coffee to discuss Y problem,\" and line up meetings before they even get on the plane. Showing up cold and hoping to bump into the right people is amateur hour.\n\nThe hallway conversations you mentioned are valuable but you can't rely on luck. Our customers who maximize events have a clear hit list of people they want to meet, actively seek them out during breaks, and have a 30 second pitch ready that's relevant to that specific person's situation.\n\nFollow-up within 24 hours matters way more than the initial conversation. Most people collect business cards and never follow up, or they wait a week when the person has already forgotten who they are. Send a personalized message the next morning referencing something specific from your conversation and propose a clear next step.\n\nFor measuring ROI, track how many qualified meetings you booked, how many turned into pipeline, and how many closed. Our clients typically need to generate at least 5-10x the event cost in pipeline to justify attending. If you're spending $3k on travel and tickets, you better be creating $15-30k in potential deals.\n\nSponsoring or speaking at events can work but it's way more expensive and the ROI is harder to track. Better to attend strategically and work the room before you invest in sponsorships.\n\nThe biggest mistake is treating events as networking for the sake of networking. Every conversation should have a purpose tied to your business goals, whether that's finding customers, partners, or learning about the market. Social hanging out is fine but it's not growth.",

I agree that pre-event outreach and fast follow-up contribute significantly to most of the ROI.\n\nWhat I would add from my experience is that events create an added value of compounding value when you show up consistently. It is not only the deals you can trace directly to one conference, but it is the recognition and familiarity that builds over time. When investors or partners keep seeing you, the conversation starts from a warmer place. Cold emails cannot replicate that.",

          "body": "The personalization vs scale thing is a false choice because you're thinking about it wrong. You can't do true 1:1 personalization at scale, period. Anyone telling you otherwise is selling you automation tools that produce mediocre results.\n\nHere's what actually works: tier your prospects based on deal size and fit. Your top 20% of prospects get real personalization where you spend 10-15 minutes researching each one and writing custom messages. These are the accounts that'll actually move your revenue if they close. The other 80% get semi-personalized templates where you swap in relevant details but the core message is proven.\n\nFor the high-value tier, find a trigger event or specific detail about their business and lead with that. \"Saw you just opened a second location\" or \"noticed your job posting for X role\" shows you actually looked. Then connect that insight to the problem you solve. This approach with 10 highly targeted prospects per day beats 100 generic emails every time.\n\nFor the volume tier, create 5-6 different message templates based on common pain points in your target market. Match prospects to the right template based on their industry or role, then personalize just the first line with something you can find quickly like their company name and a relevant detail. Our clients doing this hit good response rates without spending hours per prospect.\n\nThe \"growth hack\" you're looking for doesn't exist. Tools that claim to personalize at scale using AI just produce obvious automated crap that gets ignored. Recipients can tell when you're faking personalization and it's worse than just being upfront about sending a targeted message to multiple people.\n\nStop trying to personalize everything and focus on targeting better. If you're reaching out to the right people with a message that's relevant to their specific situation, you don't need to mention their dog's name from LinkedIn to get a response. Relevance matters way more than personalization.\n\nThe real answer is you gotta pick your battles. High-value accounts get the white glove treatment, everyone else gets good targeting with light personalization. Trying to deeply personalize every single outreach message is how you send 10 emails per week and wonder why you're not hitting quota.",

      "selftext": "Hey folks, I just wanted to share a quick breakdown of how to *actually* get Facebook Ads to work if you’re running an eCommerce store. I know a lot of people burn through ad budgets with little return, so here’s a simplified 3-part structure I’ve seen work (and use for my own clients).\n\nIf you’re just boosting posts or running random \"Buy Now\" ads, you’re probably missing out. FB Ads take planning and structure and here’s a basic funnel that works:\n\n**1. Top-of-Funnel (Awareness)**  \n*Goal: Get attention from cold audiences.*\n\n* Target broad lookalikes, interests, and demographics.\n* Focus on *what makes your brand/products different*. No hard selling.\n* Test multiple creatives and let FB optimize via CBO.\n* Use \\~70% of your ad budget here — this fuels the rest of the funnel.\n* Always exclude warm audiences so you don’t confuse attribution.\n\n**2. Middle-of-Funnel (Consideration)**  \n*Goal: Educate people who already know you.*\n\n* Target website visitors, video viewers, IG engagers, email subs, etc.\n* Offer value: guides, testimonials, behind-the-scenes, discount codes.\n* Refresh creatives regularly to avoid ad fatigue.\n* Use about 15% of your budget here.\n* Exclude people who already purchased or are in BoF.\n\n**3. Bottom-of-Funnel (Conversions)**  \n*Goal: Turn warm leads into buyers.*\n\n* Hit up cart abandoners, product viewers, email leads.\n* Use urgency: “only 2 left,” time-limited promos, UGC/testimonials.\n* CTA should be super clear: “Buy Now,” “Get 20% Off,” etc.\n* Use sequential retargeting (e.g. Day 1-3 → 10% off, Day 4-6 → FOMO).\n* Again, exclude recent buyers.\n* Around 15% of your budget goes here — this is where the 💰 is made.\n\n**TL;DR**  \nFacebook Ads *can* work for eComm, but only if you approach them like a real funnel. Most brands mess up by going straight for the sale. Instead, guide people from awareness → consideration → conversion, and always track performance with the FB Pixel + Google Analytics attribution.\n\nLet me know if you want me to share ad examples or campaign setup tips.\n\n(Source: Based on a blog by Luke Nevill from Kurve)",

      "title": "I Analyzed 250 Affiliate Programs: Here's What Really Works",
      "selftext": "For full context and transparency, I work at Rewardful (affiliate management software), so I analyzed revenue data from 250 Rewardful-powered affiliate programs that collectively generated $68.4 million in the last 12 months.\n\nThis analysis focuses on customer referral patterns and revenue generation across different program sizes. While the data is fully anonymized, it includes various SaaS and AI companies across different growth stages.\n\nThe data tracks referred customer journeys from initial signup (leads) through to successful conversion (paying customers).\n\nTo provide deeper context and real-world perspective on these findings, I consulted with industry leaders from major SaaS companies and affiliate marketing experts.\n\nLooking at the revenue patterns, I discovered several interesting insights:\n\n* **Enterprise Segment**: Programs generating $1M+ annually (6% of analyzed programs) maintain an average commission rate of 24.5% and account for $21.8M of total revenue. These programs process higher volumes of referred customers, averaging 57,575 leads and 9,558 conversions per program.‍\n* **Mid-Market Success**: Programs in the $100k-$500k range represent 44% of analyzed programs and collectively generate $23.4M in annual revenue. These programs average 5,507 referred leads and 1,076 conversions each, with a 20.7% average commission rate.‍\n* **Small-Mid Market**: Programs in the $500k-$1M range (9.2% of analyzed programs) generate $16.5M in total revenue. These programs average 7,854 referred leads and 3,657 conversions per program, with a 19.1% average commission rate.‍\n* **Small Programs**: Programs under $100k (40.8% of analyzed programs) account for $6.7M in total revenue. These programs average 1,328 referred leads and 393 conversions per program, with a 22.1% average commission rate.\n\nIt's important to note that this data represents referred customer activity, not the number of affiliates in each program.\n\nHere are some more interesting key findings from my analysis:\n\n# Program Maturity Impacts Revenue\n\nPrograms aged 3-4 years average $330k in annual sales, compared to $120k for programs under 1 year old. However, this needs context: older programs represent a smaller sample size (43 programs vs 18 programs), and survivor bias may influence these figures.\n\n# Value-Focused Referrals Show Promise\n\nSome programs achieve significant revenue with focused referral conversion. For example, one program generated $640k in revenue with 92 referred customers, of whom 84 converted to paying customers (91.3% conversion rate), averaging $7,620 per successful conversion.\n\n# Commission Structure Varies by Scale\n\nPrograms generating $1M+ annually average 24.5% commission rates with less variation (standard deviation: 7.6%), while smaller programs show more commission rate diversity.\n\nThe data suggests mature programs gravitate toward consistent commission structures:\n\n* **$1M+:** 24.5% average (±7.6%)\n* **$500k-1M:** 19.1% average (±7.9%)\n* **$100k-500k:** 20.7% average (±10.9%)\n* **Under $100k:** 22.1% average (±10.3%)\n\n# Mid-Market Segment Strength\n\nThe $100k-500k revenue segment comprises 44% of analyzed programs and generates $23.4M in total revenue. These programs average 5,507 referred leads and 1,076 conversions per program, suggesting efficient customer acquisition at moderate scale.\n\n**So what does this mean for affiliate managers and program owners? Collected a few action items below:**\n\n* Focus on quality over quantity: High-converting referrals can drive substantial revenue even with lower volume\n* Invest in competitive commission rates to attract committed affiliates\n* Set realistic timeline expectations - programs typically peak at 3-4 years\n* Structure your program based on your business model - high-volume consumer vs. targeted B2B approaches both show success paths\n* Consider both high-volume and focused referral approaches. The data shows two viable paths:\n* High-volume programs (1,000+ leads) average $439,974 in revenue with lower revenue per conversion ($286)\n* Plan for commission structure evolution. Data suggests successful programs refine their commission strategies over time:\n   * Larger programs show more consistent commission rates (standard deviation ±7.6%)\n   * Early-stage programs show more variability (standard deviation ±10.9%)\n   * Consider starting with flexible rates that can be optimized based on performance\n   * Focused programs (11-50 leads) can achieve significant results, averaging $127,285 in revenue with much higher revenue per conversion ($16,535)\n* Set realistic timeline expectations. Program maturity shows interesting patterns:\n   * Years 0-1: $123,233 average revenue (18 programs)\n   * Years 1-2: $266,925 average revenue (91 programs)\n   * Years 3-4: $329,247 average revenue (43 programs)\n   * Years 4+: Variable performance (39 programs)\n* Match strategy to business model:\n   * B2B/high-ticket: Focus on conversion quality (top programs achieve $7,000+ per conversion)\n   * High-volume/consumer: Optimize for scale (successful programs convert 1,000+ customers annually)\n\nHappy to answer any questions you have or get any further insights from your experience!",

A few things really stood out to me:\n\n* The performance of focused referral programs (like the one with a 91% conversion rate and $7.6k per customer) is a great reminder that affiliate success isn’t always about volume alignment and targeting matter a *lot*.\n* Love the point about commission structure consistency in mature programs. It makes sense that successful programs eventually \"settle in\" to what works, while earlier-stage ones are still experimenting.\n* That 3-4 year peak timeline is a helpful benchmark. It's easy to expect immediate results, but this data shows affiliate programs need real runway to mature.\n\nCurious did you notice any patterns in what channels or types of affiliates drove the most valuable referrals (content creators, communities, influencers, etc.)? Would be interesting to dig into that side of the funnel too.",

Retention went up again and feedback was way more positive.

Warm up 15 minutes before by replying to 10 niche accounts, then ask 3 friends/users to answer your question in the first 5 minutes. Put the question in line 1 so replies start fast. Aim for a pick-a-side prompt tied to your build, not generic drama. Use native media: a raw dashboard screenshot or a 20s clip with subtitles beats polished graphics. Post when top followers are active; follow with replies for 10–15 minutes. If it pops, quote-reply the best takes with mini-stories, pin a relevant landing page, and ship a next-day “what changed” update.\n\nI use Typefully for drafts/analytics, Tweet Hunter for hook ideas, and XBeast to automate a consistent posting cadence so I don’t miss days.\n\nBottom line: consistency primes the algo; one sharp, emotional question lights the fuse.",

          "body": "Your conversion problem isn't about follower count, it's that social media followers are passive scrollers, not buyers. 1k followers sounds good but if only 2 out of 4 seats fill, those followers aren't your target market or you're not giving them a reason to actually book.\n\nHere's what actually works for our clients running local workshops and classes:\n\nStop relying on organic social as your main channel. Instagram and TikTok are great for awareness but terrible for driving immediate bookings. People see your post, think \"that's cool,\" and keep scrolling. You need channels that create urgency and capture intent when people are actually ready to sign up.\n\nEmail list is critical. Offer a free mini-guide or tips related to your workshop topic in exchange for emails. Then send a weekly email to that list announcing your next workshop with early bird pricing. Email converts way better than hoping people see your Instagram post at the right time.\n\nLocal partnerships work insanely well for workshops. Find coffee shops, coworking spaces, art supply stores, or other businesses where your target audience hangs out. Offer to leave flyers, do a free demo workshop, or split revenue on referrals. Our clients doing this fill workshops faster than any social media strategy.\n\nEventbrite or similar platforms give you access to people actively searching for local workshops. Yeah they take a cut but the people finding you there are ready to buy, not just browsing content.\n\nYour pricing or offer might be off too. If you're consistently half full, either your price is too high for the value or the workshop topic isn't compelling enough. Test running one session at 30% off and see if it fills. If it does, your pricing is the problem. If it still doesn't, your topic or targeting is wrong.\n\nSocial proof is huge for workshops. Get testimonials and photos from your current attendees and plaster them everywhere. Video testimonials work even better. People need to see that others enjoyed it before they'll commit.\n\nRun a referral program where past attendees get a discount or free seat if they bring a friend. Word of mouth from actual participants beats any social media content you can create.\n\nFor Instagram and TikTok specifically, stop posting generic creative content and start showing behind the scenes of actual workshops with happy participants. User generated content of people doing the workshop activity is way more compelling than you just talking about it.\n\nThe harsh truth is filling 2 out of 4 seats means you either haven't found product market fit yet or your marketing isn't reaching people who'd actually pay. Focus less on growing followers and more on converting the audience you have by making the offer more compelling and using channels where people are ready to buy.",

      "selftext": "After auditing over 100 Google Analytics 4 setups for growth hackers and SaaS teams, we kept seeing the same issues quietly killing growth. Here are a few in case they help anyone.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*1. Broken cross-domain tracking:\\*\\* Many teams enable GA4 but forget to configure cross-domain measurement correctly. Sessions split as users bounce between marketing sites, apps and checkouts. In one audit, 30% of paid sessions were attributed to \"Direct\" because user sessions were broken. The fix is to add your domains under \"Configure your domains\" in GA4 Admin and use a consistent referral exclusion list.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*2. Event overload & duplicates:\\*\\* It's tempting to instrument every possible event. But duplicate events like \\`purchase\\` vs \\`checkout\\_complete\\` inflate counts and break funnel analysis. We trimmed event schemas down to a handful of conversion events (signup, trial\\_start, purchase) and used parameters for context.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*3. Missing micro-conversions:\\*\\* Most dashboards only track final purchases. We added micro-conversions such as pricing-page visits and feature engagements. This revealed drop-off points and allowed for targeted product changes. In one case a tooling update to the pricing page raised conversion by 15%.\n\n\n\nWe actually built an internal tool to run these audits quickly and productized it later. We also use complementary tools like Cursor (an AI dev environment) to speed up analysis. Curious if anyone here has found other GA4 pitfalls or growth insights? Let's discuss!",

          "body": "The metrics that predict conversion are completely different for every product. What matters for a project management tool is totally different than what matters for an analytics platform. You gotta figure out your specific activation moment, not copy what works for someone else.\n\nThat said, the universal pattern is this: users who reach a core value moment in the first week convert at way higher rates than those who don't. For Slack it's sending 2000 messages. For Dropbox it's putting a file in one folder. You need to figure out what that moment is for your product.\n\nOur clients running PLG usually track these leading indicators: feature adoption depth (how many core features did they use), invite rate (did they bring teammates), return visits in first 7 days, and time to first value (how fast did they accomplish their main goal).\n\nThe mistake most teams make is tracking vanity metrics like logins or page views instead of actions that actually correlate with paying. You need to work backwards from your best customers. Look at what they did in their first 30 days that free users who churned didn't do.\n\nRun a cohort analysis. Take users who converted in the last 6 months and compare their first 30 days of behavior to users who didn't convert. The patterns will jump out. Maybe converters invite 3 plus teammates, or they use a specific feature combo, or they log in 5 plus times in week one. That's your activation metric.\n\nFor tracking, most teams use a combination of Amplitude or Mixpanel for event tracking, plus your CRM to tie it to revenue. Set up automated cohorts that flag high intent users so your sales team can reach out at the right moment.\n\nAlso, 30 days is arbitrary. Some products show intent signals in 3 days, others take 60. Don't force a timeline, let the data tell you when conversion likelihood becomes clear.\n\nThe real work isn't in tracking metrics, it's in optimizing onboarding to push more users toward those predictive behaviors. Once you know what predicts conversion, redesign your product experience to drive users to do those things faster.",

Real results come from designing the system around the model, not just crafting words.\n\n\n\nHere are 5 agentic AI patterns that actually make LLMs useful:\n\n\n\nReflection – Make the model review and improve its own output before it ships. Cuts sloppy mistakes in code, summaries, and detail heavy work.\n\n\n\nTool Use – Stop expecting the LLM to “know” everything. Let it pull real data from APIs, databases, or code execution instead of hallucinating.\n\n\n\nReAct (Reason + Act) – Let it think, take an action, assess, and loop. It navigates instead of guessing once and locking in.\n\n\n\nPlanning – Break big goals into clear, sequential steps. Handle them one at a time. Essential for multi step workflows.\n\n\n\nMulti Agent – Give agents roles (researcher, planner, coder, reviewer). Let them collaborate and disagree for sharper results.\n\n\n\nCore insight:\n\nThe intelligence isn’t in the model, it’s in the scaffolding you build around it. Prompts are fragile.

At 50 people you should already know which channels work for your specific product.\n\nThe answer depends entirely on what you're selling and who's buying. There's no universal \"best channel\" for SaaS. Our clients running enterprise tools get most leads from content and SEO. Clients selling to SMBs do better with paid ads and cold email. It's all context dependent.\n\nThat said, here's what generally works at your stage:\n\nAds are good if you have clear ROI and can afford the CPCs in your space. Google Search ads for high intent keywords convert well if people are actively searching for your solution. LinkedIn ads work for B2B but they're expensive as hell. Facebook is mostly garbage for B2B SaaS unless you're selling to very specific industries.\n\nCold email still works but deliverability is harder now. You need good lists, proper infrastructure, and personalization that doesn't sound like AI generated crap. At your company size you should have SDRs doing this properly with multi channel cadences, not just blasting emails.\n\nCommunities are the slowest burn but often highest quality leads. Being genuinely helpful in relevant Slack groups, Discord servers, or niche forums builds trust. But it takes months of consistent participation before you see results. This works best when your product people or engineers are active, not just sales reps dropping links.\n\nThe real question is what's already working for you that you can double down on. At 50 people you should have data on which channels brought your current customers. Do more of what's proven and cut what's not working.\n\nStop looking for the magic channel and start optimizing the fundamentals. Most SaaS companies at your size have leaky funnels, bad onboarding, or unclear positioning that kills conversion regardless of which channel brings traffic.",

Also track user complaints and give them the exact solution, those would be the people with high purchase intent. \n\nCold email is the least cost intensive way and can go a long way.

Over time your skills and knowledge will increase and you might be able to figure out some on your own! \n\nBut I also have to say that some of them can be very challenging and even some of the smartest “hackers” in the world will get stumped by a CTF and they too have to follow someone else’s write up.

You're throwing tactics at the wall without understanding why nobody's buying.\n\nThe hard truth is if you \"suck at social media\" and can't create content that gets views, you're gonna have a rough time selling digital products. That entire business model relies on content marketing and organic reach. It's not just a nice to have, it's literally how you compete.\n\nPinterest takes 3 to 6 months minimum to see real traffic. TikTok rewards people who post consistently and understand the platform. If you're forcing yourself to do something you're not good at and don't enjoy, you're setting yourself up to burn out before you see any results.\n\nRunning ads without an audience or proven offer is burning money. Our clients who sell digital products only run ads after they've validated that people actually want what they're selling organically first. If you can't get free traffic converting, paid traffic definitely won't save you.\n\nHere's what you should actually consider. What problem does your digital product solve and who desperately needs that solution? If you can't answer that clearly, the product is the issue, not your marketing. Digital products succeed when they solve a specific painful problem for a specific audience. \"I made a thing and now need to market it\" is backwards.\n\nAlso, Reddit ads for digital products usually perform like crap unless you're targeting super specific communities. Pinterest ads might work depending on your niche but again, only if your organic content is already getting some traction.\n\nThe wanting to escape your job thing is completely valid, but starting a business out of desperation rarely works. You need either skills that translate to income (freelancing, consulting) or a product people actually want. Just wanting it badly isn't enough.\n\nIf you're set on digital products, pick the one platform you're least terrible at and focus only on that for 90 days. Not Pinterest and TikTok and going live and ads. Just one thing, done consistently and well. Most people fail because they spread too thin, not because they didn't try enough channels.",

      "title": "The Underrated Power of Faking It 'Til You Make It",
      "selftext": "There's a lot of talk in growth circles about data pipelines, automation, and scalable systems. We're obsessed with building engines that can acquire users at a volume that would make any CFO smile. But in this relentless focus on building a machine that reaches a million users, we often neglect the subtle art of looking like we already have a thousand.\n\nThe most significant blind spot isn't in the technology; it's in the narrative. A new user arriving at a product, a channel, or a profile that shows minimal activity is subconsciously making a risk assessment. They are asking, \"Is this worth my time and attention?\" An empty comment section, a low view count, or a barren community feed is a resounding \"no.\" This is the silent killer of virality. You can have the most efficient user acquisition funnel in the world, but if the destination feels empty, your retention will be abysmal, and your growth will flatline. You're not just fighting for a user's click; you're fighting for their belief.\n\nThis is where the principle of \"social proof\" transitions from a marketing buzzword into a critical growth lever. It's not about vanity; it's about velocity. A base layer of engagement acts as a psychological primer. It tells the new user that others have already vetted this space and found it valuable. It reduces the cognitive load of decision-making for them. They are far more likely to engage, subscribe, or sign up because the path has been walked before. This initial engagement also sends a powerful signal to platform algorithms, convincing them that your content is worthy of being amplified to a wider, organic audience. It's the spark that can ignite the fire.\n\nThe hack, then, is to strategically manufacture that initial proof of concept. This isn't about long-term deception; it's about short-term narrative control. It's about giving your genuinely good product or content the fighting chance it deserves by making it look established and active from the moment the first real user arrives. For this to work, the manufactured engagement must be credible, blending seamlessly with organic activity to avoid detection and user skepticism.\n\nOperationalizing this requires a source that can deliver this foundational layer with a degree of authenticity. In a recent launch, leveraging a service to generate this initial activity was the key that unlocked everything else. Using Viewtiful Day to create a realistic baseline of engagement on our core content allowed our first wave of paid and organic traffic to land in an environment that felt alive. The conversion rate from visitor to registered user skyrocketed because the barrier to entry, the fear of joining a ghost town was eliminated. This initial momentum was the crucial difference between the algorithm working against us and working for us. Sometimes, the most powerful growth hack is simply having the wisdom to stage the set before the real audience arrives.\n\n",

          "body": "Scraping tools are cheap for a reason, the data quality is usually crap. You'll end up with outdated emails, wrong contact info, and people who've been contacted a thousand times already. That said, if budget is tight, here's what actually works.\n\nLinkedIn scrapers like PhantomBuster or Apify can pull contact info but LinkedIn is cracking down hard on this. You risk getting your account banned if you're not careful with rate limits. Our clients who use these tools always run them on secondary LinkedIn accounts, never their main one.\n\nFor company data, you can use Hunter.io or Snov.io for email finding. They're way cheaper than Apollo and the verification is decent. You give them a domain and they find emails associated with it. Not perfect but good enough for cold outreach on a budget.\n\nGoogle Maps scrapers work if you're targeting local businesses. Tools like Outscraper or Bright Data can pull business info from Maps listings. The data is public so it's less sketchy than scraping LinkedIn, but you're still limited to what's publicly listed.\n\nThe \"buying lead lists from resellers\" thing is a terrible idea. Those lists are sold to hundreds of people and everyone on them is getting spammed to death. Deliverability will tank and response rates will be nonexistent. Don't waste your money.\n\nHere's the real talk though. Cheap scraped leads perform like shit compared to manually built lists. If you're serious about outreach, spend the time building a targeted list yourself. Use LinkedIn search to find your ideal prospects, then use Hunter or similar tools to find their emails one by one. Takes longer but the quality is way better.\n\nFor fresh leads, focus on trigger events instead of random scraping. Use Google Alerts for companies that just got funding, hired for certain roles, or announced expansions. Those are way better targets than cold scraped lists because they're actually in a buying window.\n\nIf you're doing cold email at volume with scraped data, your deliverability is gonna be the biggest problem. Doesn't matter how many leads you have if they all land in spam. You need proper email infrastructure, domain warmup, and list verification before sending anything. Tools like NeverBounce or ZeroBounce are essential to clean your lists first.\n\nThe growth hacker workflow that actually works is this: LinkedIn search for ideal prospects, export to CSV using a scraper, enrich with Hunter or Apollo API, verify emails with NeverBounce, then send through a proper cold email tool with warmed domains. It's not free but it's way cheaper than buying premium tools.\n\nHonestly though, if you can't afford proper data tools, you probably shouldn't be doing high volume outreach yet. Focus on quality over quantity. Manually reach out to 10 perfect fit prospects per day instead of blasting 500 scraped contacts. You'll get better results and won't burn your reputation.",

I've been helping companies scale through OGTool and the whole \"scrape leads to blast cold emails\" approach is becoming less effective every month. Even with perfect data quality, your still fighting inbox fatigue and people who are just tired of being pitched to constantly.\n\nWhat's working way better right now is finding where your ideal customers are already complaining about problems you solve. Reddit communities, LinkedIn comment sections, Twitter replies to industry posts. Yeah it takes more time upfront but the conversion rates are insane compared to cold scraped lists. Instead of spending money on lead scrapers, spend that time building relationships in places where your prospects actually hang out and talk about their pain points. Way cheaper and the leads are basically pre qualified because they're actively discussing the problem you solve.",

I was thinking about cold outreach with them (I know it's spammy).

          "body": "Cold email for AI automation services is saturated as hell right now. Every freelancer with access to Make or n8n is pitching the same generic \"automate your business\" stuff. You're gonna get ignored unless you differentiate hard.\n\nThe \"big email lead database\" is probably garbage. Those lists are resold a thousand times and everyone on them is getting hammered with cold emails daily. Deliverability will be trash and response rates even worse. Our clients who buy lead databases always regret it compared to building their own targeted lists.\n\nHere's what you gotta do differently. Pick one specific industry and one specific automation problem. Not \"AI and automation for businesses\" but \"automating lead qualification for real estate agencies\" or \"workflow automation for accounting firms.\" The tighter your niche, the easier it is to write emails that don't sound like spam.\n\nFor US business owners, your emails need to be short as hell. Three sentences max in the first email. Reference something specific about their business, mention one concrete problem you can solve, ask if they're open to a quick chat. No pitching features, no talking about yourself. Just problem and potential solution.\n\nSubject lines matter way more than you think. Avoid anything that screams marketing like \"boost your productivity\" or \"AI solution.\" Go with conversational stuff like \"quick question about \\[their company\\]\" or \"saw you're hiring for \\[role\\].\" Boring subjects get opened more than clever ones.\n\nYour deliverability is gonna suck if you're blasting from one domain. You need proper email infrastructure with multiple sending domains, SPF, DKIM, DMARC all set up correctly, and you need to warm up your domains for weeks before sending volume. Skip this and you land in spam immediately.\n\nAlso, being not from the US is fine but your English needs to be perfect. Any grammar mistakes or weird phrasing kills trust instantly. Have a native speaker review your templates before sending.\n\nThe biggest thing though is you can't just blast a database and hope for replies. You need to manually research each company, find a real problem they have, and personalize the outreach. That means maybe 20 to 30 emails per day max, not hundreds. Quality over quantity or you're just burning your domains and reputation.\n\nCold email works but only if you're solving a specific urgent problem for a narrow audience and your execution is flawless. Generic AI automation pitches to random businesses won't get you anywhere.",

This isn't some breakthrough solution, it's been standard practice for years.\n\nPut the booking link directly on the form confirmation page or in the immediate autoresponder. Boom, problem solved without building anything new.\n\nThe real question is whether your leads actually want to book immediately. High intent leads from demos or trial signups? Sure, instant booking works great. Cold traffic from content downloads? They're not ready yet and forcing a calendar feels pushy.\n\nOur clients who've tested this found it's completely dependent on lead source and what you're selling. B2B with long sales cycles? People want to research first. High ticket impulse stuff? Immediate booking can work.\n\nAlso, if half your leads are going cold between form and meeting, that's a qualification problem. You're attracting tire kickers, not serious buyers. Better filtering on the front end beats faster booking for bad leads.\n\nThe no show thing you mentioned is way bigger than booking speed. If people are canceling or not showing, your meeting value proposition sucks or you're booking people who were never qualified. One click rescheduling doesn't fix that, better qualification does.\n\nStop trying to solve a speed problem when you've got a quality problem. Your follow up emails are probably generic, you're likely taking too long to respond, or these aren't even qualified leads to begin with. Fix the lead quality and qualification process first before obsessing over shaving minutes off the booking process.",

      "selftext": "Our product is currently in the cold start stage, and user acquisition has become our biggest challenge. As a startup team, we’re facing several core dilemmas when it comes to choosing the right marketing strategies, and I’d love to hear your thoughts.\n\nWe’ve considered influencer marketing—it’s undeniably an effective channel. But the reality is that working with high-quality KOLs is simply too expensive for a small team like ours. Even mid-tier influencers often quote prices that go beyond what we can realistically afford.\n\nTo save costs, we’ve tried running our own social media for product promotion. But we’ve run into several problems: 1、Content creation and social media management require professional resources, while our team is primarily tech-focused. 2、Organic reach hasn’t been great, and conversion rates are relatively low. 3、Most importantly, I worry that excessive promotion could hurt our product’s credibility and professional image. As a user myself, I’ve always disliked ads that treat the audience as if they’re naive—and I’ve definitely learned a hard lesson from that.\n\nLately, I’ve been asking myself: in today’s information-overloaded world, where users are increasingly sensitive to marketing messages, how can we strike the right balance between effective promotion and maintaining brand trust?\n\nWith an extremely limited budget, which marketing strategies are truly effective and feasible?\n\nBeyond traditional social media and influencer marketing, what overlooked but high-potential acquisition channels exist?\n\nPS: Our product is a financial news tracking tool, and to be honest, there are already quite a few similar products in the market…\n\nReally looking forward to hearing your experiences and advice. Any practical insights would mean a lot to us.",

          "body": "Your real problem isn't marketing strategy, it's that you built another financial news tool in a market that's already saturated. Bloomberg Terminal, Finimize, Morning Brew, Seeking Alpha, plus dozens of smaller players. Unless you're solving a problem none of them solve, no amount of clever marketing will save you.\n\nThe \"limited budget\" thing is a cop out. You don't need influencers or paid ads. You need to figure out if anyone actually wants what you built. Have you talked to 50 potential users about why they'd switch from whatever they're using now? If not, that's your first step, not marketing.\n\nFor financial tools specifically, here's what actually works on zero budget:\n\nCreate genuinely useful content that solves specific problems. Not \"check out our tool\" posts but actual analysis, data breakdowns, or insights that traders and investors can use immediately. Post on r/stocks, r/investing, FinTwit. Be helpful first, mention your tool never unless someone asks. Our clients in fintech who do this build credibility way faster than paid marketing ever could.\n\nBuild in public and share your data. If your tool tracks financial news, share interesting patterns or trends you're seeing. \"We analyzed 10k earnings calls and here's what changed\" gets attention. The insights are the marketing, not the product pitch.\n\nPartner with finance YouTubers or newsletter writers who serve your exact niche. Not paying them for promotion, but offering free access in exchange for honest feedback or feature in their content. Micro influencers in finance are way more accessible than you think.\n\nThe harsh truth is if you're a \"tech focused team\" with no marketing expertise building a product in a commoditized market, you're gonna struggle regardless of channel. Financial news tools succeed on distribution and trust, not features. You're competing against brands people already rely on.\n\nStop worrying about \"hurting credibility with too much promotion.\" Nobody knows you exist yet, so you have no credibility to protect. The bigger risk is staying invisible.\n\nIf your product is genuinely better for a specific use case, focus everything on that niche. Don't be \"another financial news tool,\" be \"the best tool for day traders tracking premarket movers\" or whatever your actual differentiator is. Then go find those specific people and help them.\n\nBut honestly, if you can't articulate why someone would switch from their current solution to yours, fix that before spending time on marketing. Product market fit comes before growth tactics.",

          "body": "ZooTools and similar viral waitlist platforms promise way more than they deliver. The \"10x growth\" marketing is complete BS for most products. Referral mechanics only work if people are already excited about your product, not as a way to create excitement from nothing.\n\nHere's the reality our clients have learned about these viral waitlist tools:\n\nThe referral loops only work if your product concept is inherently shareable and people actually want early access badly enough to spam their friends. For every successful viral waitlist like Robinhood or Superhuman, there are thousands that got maybe 50 signups total. The tool doesn't create virality, it just facilitates it if the conditions are already there.\n\nEmail deliverability from these platforms is hit or miss. Most of them aren't email focused companies, they're growth tool companies that tacked on email as a feature. You're better off using a real email platform like ConvertKit or Loops and integrating it with a simple referral system. Our clients who tried all in one solutions always ended up switching to dedicated tools because the email side was too limited.\n\nThe \"Notion like\" editor thing is marketing speak. It's probably just a drag and drop builder like every other email tool has. Nothing revolutionary about it.\n\nFor your use case with a side project, spending money on ZooTools is probably overkill. You can build a waitlist with a simple landing page, email signup form, and manual referral tracking for free. Only pay for tools like this once you've validated that people actually want what you're building and your referral program is getting traction organically.\n\nThe tracking and analytics are usually decent but not groundbreaking. You'll get basic metrics on signups, referrals, and conversion. Customer support quality varies but for smaller plans you're typically getting email support with slow response times.\n\nValue for money is questionable for early stage stuff. These tools make sense when you've got thousands of signups and need automation. For a side project pre launch, you're paying for features you don't need yet.\n\nThe biggest con nobody talks about is that viral waitlists have become tired. Users are sick of \"refer 5 friends to move up the list\" mechanics. It worked great in 2018, now it just feels manipulative and most people ignore it.\n\nBuild your product, get some early users manually, see if anyone actually wants to refer others organically. If they do, then maybe invest in a referral tool. Don't start with the tool hoping it'll solve your growth problem.",

I had a gut feeling that the “10x growth” claims might be more marketing than reality. You're right — referral loops only amplify existing excitement, they don’t generate it from scratch. That distinction is easy to forget when you see case studies like Robinhood or Superhuman, but as you said, those were rare exceptions with products people were desperate to try.\n\nYour point on email is also gold. I was wondering if it made sense to trust an all-in-one growth tool with deliverability. It sounds like sticking with a dedicated email service (like ConvertKit/Loops) and plugging in a lightweight referral layer could be a smarter route, at least until there’s proven traction.\n\nThe note about users being fatigued with “refer 5 friends to move up” mechanics really hit home too. That makes me think harder about whether I should lean into a waitlist/referral system right now or focus more on direct outreach + validating demand.\n\nSounds like the consensus is: ZooTools (and tools like it) can be useful at scale, but overkill for an early-stage side project. Better to validate first, then consider investing in automation once there’s natural momentum.\n\nReally appreciate you sharing your (and your clients’) experience — this gives me a much clearer lens on whether ZooTools is actually the right fit.",

      "selftext": "TL;DR: Everything that worked 5 years ago now makes you invisible.\n\n\n\nI spent 4 months diving deep into this question: How did successful B2B SaaS companies ACTUALLY get their first 1,000 customers?\n\nSo I analyzed 1,000 startups that hit 1K customers between 2020-2025, plus interviewed 50+ founders. The results will make you rethink everything about customer acquisition.\n\nThe Brutal Reality Check\n\n2020 tactics that worked:\n\n\n\nCheap Facebook ads ($5-15 CPC)\n\nMass cold email sequences\n\nSpray-and-pray across every channel\n\n\"Launch on Product Hunt and pray\"\n\n\n\nSame tactics in 2025:\n\n\n\nFacebook ads: $50-80 CPC (if they work at all)\n\nCold emails: 2% open rates in ChatGPT spam hell\n\nMulti-channel approach: Shouting into the void\n\nProduct Hunt: 97.4% of launches die within 6 months\n\n\n\nWhat Actually Works in 2025\n\nThe 13% of startups that succeeded did 4 things completely differently:\n\n1. They Went Ultra-Niche First\n\n2020: \"Project management for everyone\"\n\n2025: \"Project management for creative agencies with remote teams\"\n\nReal example: Notion started as a generic \"workspace tool for everyone.\" Struggled for years. Pivoted to target specific communities - first productivity nerds, then remote teams, then specific verticals. Hit 1M users with just seed funding.\n\nAnother example: Figma could have been \"design software for everyone.\" Instead, they laser-focused on collaborative design teams. Spent 3 years in stealth with essentially one customer (Coda), personally driving to debug issues. Result? $20B Adobe acquisition.\n\nWhy it works: In a saturated market, being everything to everyone makes you invisible to everyone.\n\n2. Product-Led Growth Became Mandatory\n\nThe stat that shocked me: 100% of buyers now want to self-serve at least part of the buying journey.\n\nWhat this means: If I can't try your product in 60 seconds without talking to sales, I'm going to your competitor who lets me.\n\nSuccess story: Loom grew to 1M users with ZERO sales team. Just a free Chrome extension with viral watermarks on every video.\n\nAnother winner: Trupeer (product demo tool) lets users create professional demo videos from rough screen recordings in minutes. Users love sharing these polished demos, creating organic word-of-mouth growth.\n\n3. Community > Advertising\n\nThe winners didn't buy attention. They earned it.\n\nExample: Tailscale built a 40k-member subreddit where users obsess over their product. That community drives more qualified leads than any ad campaign ever could.\n\nAnother case: Notion's template community became their secret weapon. Users share custom templates across social media, creating organic discovery loops. Over 90% of their traffic now comes from organic sources.\n\nThe insight: In 2025, peer recommendations beat vendor marketing 16:1. Your customers are your best salespeople.\n\n4. AI + Human Touch\n\nWhat everyone's doing wrong: Using AI to blast more generic messages\n\nWhat winners do: Using AI to research, then adding genuine human insight\n\nReal example: Airtable built 200+ SEO-optimized templates, each solving specific problems. Hit $5.77B valuation.\n\nAnother success: Trupeer users create and share professional demo videos, which become discoverable content driving organic sign-ups.\n\nResult: 34% response rate vs. 2% industry average.\n\nThe Pattern I Found in Every Success Story\n\nEvery successful founder I interviewed had this exact journey:\n\n\n\nStarted hyper-focused (Figma: collaborative design teams, not \"design software\")\n\nBuilt community first (Notion: productivity nerds → template sharing ecosystem)\n\nLet customers drive growth (Airtable: 200+ user-generated templates)\n\nUsed AI to scale authentically (Trupeer: AI-generated demos that users love sharing)\n\n\n\nThe Pattern in Every Failure\n\nFailed startups all made the same mistakes:\n\n\n\n\"We'll figure out customers after we build\"\n\nTried to be everything to everyone\n\nRelied on 2020 growth hacks in 2025\n\nConfused traffic with customers\n\n\n\nThe Most Expensive Lesson\n\nCost of customer acquisition by year:\n\n\n\n2020: $30-50 average\n\n2025: $300-500 average\n\n\n\nTranslation: You need 10x better targeting or you're dead.\n\nWhat This Means for Your Startup\n\nIf you're building a B2B SaaS right now, ask yourself:\n\n\n\nCan you define your ideal customer in one sentence? (Not \"small businesses\" – be specific)\n\nWhere do they already gather online? (This is where you build community)\n\nCan they try your product in under 2 minutes? (Self-serve is non-negotiable)\n\nDo you have 10 customers who would cry if you disappeared? (If no, you're not ready to scale)\n\n\n\nThe Uncomfortable Questions\n\nAfter this research, I can't stop thinking:\n\n\n\nWhat if most SaaS companies are solving the wrong problems?\n\nWhat if we're all building features instead of building relationships?\n\nWhat if the real competition isn't other tools – it's doing nothing?\n\n\n\nThe Data Behind This Post\n\nMethodology:\n\n\n\nAnalyzed 1,000 startups that reached 1K customers (2020-2025)\n\n50+ founder interviews (45-min each)\n\nTracked CAC, conversion rates, primary acquisition channels\n\nCross-referenced with public funding/revenue data\n\n\n\nKey finding: The median successful startup focused on 1 customer segment for their first 500 customers, then expanded.\n\nWhat Keeps Me Up at Night\n\nThe scariest trend: 67% of founders I interviewed are still using 2020 tactics in 2025.\n\nThey're burning cash on strategies that worked when competition was lighter and attention was cheaper.\n\nReal casualties:\n\n\n\nStartups spending $50-80 CPC on Facebook ads (vs $5-15 in 2020)\n\nCompanies with 2% email open rates stuck in \"ChatGPT spam hell\"\n\nFounders doing generic \"spray and pray\" while niche players dominate\n\n\n\nThe opportunity: The 33% who adapted are growing 3x faster with half the budget.\n\nQuestions for r/entrepreneur\n\n\n\nFor successful founders: What % of your first 1K customers came from paid ads vs. community/referrals?\n\nFor struggling founders: Are you still trying to be everything to everyone?\n\nFor everyone: What's the most money you've wasted on acquisition tactics that don't work anymore?\n\n\n\nMy Prediction\n\nBy 2026, the only B2B SaaS companies that survive will be:\n\n\n\nLaser-focused on specific niches\n\nCommunity-driven (not ad-driven)\n\nProduct-led (buyers won't tolerate sales friction)\n\nAI-enhanced but human-centered\n\n\n\nHot take: The \"unicorn or bust\" mindset killed more startups than bad products ever did.\n\nFigma focused on 1 customer for 3 years. Notion nearly died, moved to Kyoto, coded in underwear for a year. Airtable started with spreadsheet nerds.\n\nWhat they had in common: Obsessive focus on specific users, not growth metrics.\n\nWhat do you think? Are you still fighting 2025 wars with 2020 weapons?\n\nP.S. - The full dataset with specific acquisition breakdowns is wild.",

In 2025 the winners do three boring-but-lethal things:\n\n**1) Niche, then narrate.** One ICP, one job-to-be-done, ruthless exclusions. Build a POV that *adds information gain* (not another “ultimate guide”). My filter: **Information Gain + Authority + Experience** (Ethan Smith’s triad).\n\n**2) Product-led + zero-friction.** Try in <2 minutes, no calendar hostage. Instrument the first 5 minutes; if activation doesn’t climb weekly, nothing else matters.\n\n**3) Community > rented reach.** Founder-led, plain-text newsletter + replies beats social impressions. I’ve seen **40–60% opens** on focused B2B lists when you ship **6–8 useful items** and a single CTA. Email is the durable hub; social is distribution.\n\n**Bonus in 2025: AEO > SEO-only.** Buyers start with LLMs. Structure content for **Answer Engine Optimization** (clear entities, FAQs, cited sources, log-file hygiene). Track reference/citation rate, not just SERPs.\n\n**My early-stage checklist (what actually moved the needle):**\n\n* Define one ICP sentence; say who you *don’t* serve.\n* Ship a founder newsletter every 2 weeks (curate > create; replies are the KPI).\n* Self-serve in 60–120s; measure activation, not demo requests.\n* Use **DeepResearch** for briefs; repurpose into templates/tools (not posts).\n* Audit logs + schema for AEO; GA4 won’t show AI crawler behavior.\n* Expand only after 200–500 customers in the first segment ask for the next one.\n\nIf helpful, I summarized playbooks on **founder-led newsletters, AEO, and the “curate > create” system** here (free): [https://newsletter.zestscout.com/](https://newsletter.zestscout.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) — curious to compare notes with your dataset.",

      "title": "Large TAM is a trap that kills your outreach",
      "selftext": "One thing I’ve seen repeatedly in B2B sales, especially in early-stage companies, is what I call the TAM trap.   \n  \nMy team worked on 20+ B2B sales projects over the past year across fintech, SaaS, AI, infra, and one pattern shows up almost every time   \n  \nYou build a product with many possible applications: AI-something, crypto, HR-tech, etc. Either way, the market looks huge. You can think of dozens of verticals where the product could fit. On paper, it feels like a dream: so many directions to explore and leads to reach out to. But when it comes to outbound, that’s exactly where things start falling apart.   \n  \nMost teams make the same move: they grab a big list, write a couple of messages, and blast it to everyone. It feels like progress since you’re doing sales, getting activity, and moving. But the results don’t come. Instead, you get low replies, burned domains, and a team that starts saying: maybe outbound just doesn’t work for us.   \n  \nThis came up recently on our project with a European crypto-fintech company handling mass payment flows. They process over $1B annually and already had strong traction through channels like founder-led sales and partnerships. Their potential market looked massive: marketplaces, SaaS tools with remote teams, creator platforms, OTC desks. On paper, it was tempting to go wide and try reaching everyone at once.   \n  \nBut instead of following that path and risking the usual spray-and-pray results we narrowed in early.  \n1/ We started by pulling data from multiple sources: conference lists, business directories, Sales Navigator. Instead of going straight to contacts, we compiled large sets of websites and ran surface-level checks to see whether crypto was actually relevant for them.   \n2/ Another key signal was technical readiness. A lot of teams say they’re exploring crypto, but in reality, they don’t have the resources to ship a new API. So we filtered them out.   \n3/ From there, we segmented them by pain points.  \n  \nSome cared about mass payouts, others were more focused on accepting payments, a third group was looking for OTC rails or better liquidity management. so on and so forth   \n  \nWe also added a vertical-level and segmented them by business model on top: marketplaces/creator economy/tokenization.   \n  \nThat gave us a multi-layered view: **segment × pain × vertical — and with it, 50+ distinct combinations of message and offer.** We ended up analyzing hundreds of thousands of companies, and there's a still long tail ahead.   \n  \n4/ Message-wise, even small changes made a difference. We made sure every offer had a clear rationale.   \nIf a company moved serious volume, we offered them better commission tiers, tied directly to their processing size.   \nIf they were using other payment tools, we led with compliance and regulatory reassurance.   \nIf they were a marketplace, we pitched flexible setups around their revenue.   \nCustom logic for each path.   \n  \nThe result: a stable system that consistently delivers 15–20+ qualified meetings per month — and doesn’t burn through the market.\n\n**tldr:** TAM doesn’t equal pipeline. And unless you segment early you’ll burn your market long before it starts converting.",

      "selftext": "So we’ve been studying how ecommerce sites use pop-ups and gamification recently, and we would like to share our concerns. All these spin-the-wheel discounts, promo codes, and countdown timers screaming ‘Offer ends in 10 minutes!’ are among the top-performing mechanics among our users (and across the market as well). \n\nOn the one hand, they work perfectly for first-time buyers. Customers spin, click, and buy as intended.\n\nOn the other hand, there’s a feeling that overusing these types of pop-ups might hurt trust in the long run. For returning customers, it’s like every visit is Black Friday on steroids. When every visit comes with scarcity, urgency, and gamified incentives, or when the discounts feel endless, shoppers can get exhausted and start waiting for the “better deal”, ending up not buying at all. Slowly, these tactics can train your audience to distrust regular pricing.\n\nThus, I'm curious about the side opinion: where does the community stand? From your experience, are these mechanics still effective, or do they annoy customers more than persuade them? Have you seen a point where gamified pop-ups start to backfire? \n\n",

      "title": "App Store Optimization (ASO): What Actually Moves the Needle?",
      "selftext": "App Store Optimization (ASO) is one of the most underrated ways to grow an app organically. With millions of apps competing for attention, showing up in search results is half the battle and converting that visibility into installs is the other half. Just like SEO for websites, ASO is about using the right keywords in your title, subtitle, and description to improve rankings in the App Store or Google Play.\n\nOn Apple, you get a 100-character keyword field, while Google indexes content from your description and title, so optimizing those areas is key.\n\nThe first screenshot or video thumbnail is incredibly important — it’s often what makes someone click. A/B testing visuals and descriptions can dramatically improve conversion rates. Same goes for reviews and ratings. Triggering review prompts after a positive in-app moment (like completing a task or making progress) helps drive better ratings, which boost rankings. It's also smart to respond to negative reviews and use tools to collect user feedback before they leave the app store angry.\n\nPaid ads like Apple Search Ads or Google UAC can be used strategically to jumpstart downloads, which boosts your rankings and improves organic visibility. From there, downloads can create a flywheel effect: more installs = more visibility = more installs.\n\nBut ASO isn’t a one-time task. You need to constantly monitor keyword performance, user behavior, and competition to refine your strategy.\n\nHas anyone here had success with specific ASO tactics? What’s worked (or hasn’t) for your app?",

      "title": "“Quit your job and make $20k/month in 60 days” the advice that almost ruined me",
      "selftext": "Lately, I’ve been seeing the same story everywhere:\n\n“Left my 9–5, now I work 2 hours a day from Bali”  \n“Zero to $100k/month with no experience”  \n“Fired my boss, tripled my income in 3 months”\n\nAnd for a while, I believed it. I thought I was just being too cautious.\n\nBut here’s the part they don’t tell you — most of these posts are highlight reels. They skip over the debt, the failed launches, and the fact that many of these “overnight wins” were built on years of unseen experience, networks, and savings.\n\nWhen I quit my job to go full-time on my startup, I thought my biggest challenge would be building the product. It wasn’t.  \nIt was figuring out how to survive when there was no paycheck coming every month.\n\nThe romantic version of “going all in” hides the reality:\n\nYou lose structure and have to create your own.\n\nYou burn through savings faster than you think.\n\nYou need customers *before* you need more features.\n\nI spoke to a founder who’d been running a profitable agency for 8 years. I asked how he got clients. He didn’t talk about ads or cold email scripts. He said:\n\n“Start where people already trust you. Build there first.”\n\nThat’s when I realized my mistake — I’d left my job to serve an audience I didn’t even know.\n\nNow, I test ideas while I’m still earning. I validate with small offers before building big products. I’ve learned to keep my safety net intact so I can take risks without betting the house.\n\nIf you’re thinking of quitting your job tomorrow, remember this:  \nFreedom isn’t about leaving your 9–5. It’s about having options. And options come from skills, networks, and systems you build over time.\n\nIf you want something sustainable, start here:\n\nLearn to sell before you have to sell.\n\nBuild a customer base while you still have income.\n\nDesign a runway that buys you time to experiment.\n\nTest small before committing big.\n\nEntrepreneurship isn’t a plane you jump out of without a parachute — it’s building the parachute while you’re still on the ground.\n\nSo ask yourself:  \nDo I have a clear audience?  \nCan I afford to fail a few times?  \nAm I building this because it matters to me, or because I want to escape?\n\nDon’t quit just to quit. Quit because you’ve built the skills, trust, and systems to make your next step inevitable.\n\nThat’s how real freedom is built.",

But I’d push back a little on the idea that you shouldn’t quit until everything is lined up.\n\nSometimes the structure and safety of a paycheck is exactly what keeps people stuck. Comfort can be more dangerous than risk — because it convinces you to wait until you feel “ready,” which for most people is never.\n\nYes, building skills, networks, and systems matters. But those can also be built faster when your back’s against the wall and you’re forced to move. Pressure creates focus in a way side-hustling nights and weekends often can’t.\n\nThe key isn’t “never quit” vs. “quit tomorrow.” The key is don’t do it alone. If you’ve got a community, accountability, and people breaking down real strategies with you, the leap doesn’t feel like jumping out of a plane with no parachute — it feels like skydiving with an instructor strapped to your back.\n\nSo yeah, quitting cold turkey isn’t for everyone. But waiting forever can be just as costly. Sometimes the fastest way to build freedom is to stop clinging to security and surround yourself with the right support while you take the leap.",

That didn’t exist, so I built it.\n\nThe site generates short summaries of podcasts and YouTube channels in a feed and delivers them to your inbox every morning. It helps you figure out what to watch, or skip, and discover new content. It focuses on the key takeaways and why this would be worth an hour of my time, but it's fully customisable\n\nThe feedback so far has been really positive - but I think I need someone experienced in digital marketing or growth hacking who can help take this to the next level. \n\nI'm not a dev but I got someone to build this for me - but I would love to work with someone who’s got the skills and energy to get the word out. I’m happy to offer a generous cut of the revenue. \n\nThere’s a freemium model live already: free access to 50+ curated channels, then $5 and $10 monthly options for custom channels and extra features.\n\nThe thing I really like about this is that it solves a real, simple problem that a lot of people have, so there are so many different ways to market it. \n\nGive me a shout if this sounds interesting and you'd like to learn more.",

      "title": "Interviewed 23 early-Stage Founders, Here Are the 4 Growth Tactics That Worked Repeatedly",
      "selftext": "I’ve been building Proofstories, and for the last 2 months I've been talking to founders about how they actually got their first users and traction.\n\nHere are the 4 strategies I saw working repeatedly\n\n**Sell Outcomes Before You Build**  \nThis came up multiple number of times. Sell the result first, then if you see a spark build around it. A money-back guarantee removes the buyer’s risk.\n\n* Building webhooks? Sell stripe level reliability for something that people don't really want to build themselves. \n* Running a SEO service? Sell SEO traffic growth.\n\nThis lets you test whether the problem is worth some money to people or not. You can do offer engineering to hedge the customer's risk by offering a refund guarantee.\n\n*Example: Synscribe (SEO service → SaaS) sold SEO traffic growth with a refund guarantee. This directly resulted in one client increasing their budget from $400 → $1,000/month, because the guarantee made it a no-brainer.*\n\n**Competitor Scraping + Drip Outreach**  \nInstead of cold emailing who possibly care about the problem you are trying to solve, scrape people already following your competitors and send short, benefit-driven drip campaigns. This leads to a much better conversion rate since the people you are emailing already care about the problem.\n\n*Example: Bearconnect (LinkedIn automation) got 50–60% acceptance and 24–45% reply rates by doing this.*\n\n**Play Both Sides in Communities**  \nCommunities can be a bit tricky to navigate for promoting your product or gathering feedback. A good way is to play both sides. Specifically when promoting your products in niche groups (Telegram, Reddit, Discord), post from one account asking for tool recommendations, then reply from another account recommending yours. It feels like organic word of mouth event rather than spam/self promotion. Works best for tight knit communities and only for getting your initial users.\n\n*Example: AutoViral (social growth automation) hit $1K MRR and 50 paying users in 2 months using this exact tactic.*\n\n**Partnerships + Affiliates**  \nOnce you have early traction, tap into adjacent audiences through partners. Give them affiliate links so they’re motivated to push your product. This is a great strategy since there is no upfront ad spend, purely performance-based growth.\n\n*Example: AutoViral and BearConnect partnered with creators running marketing automation courses → win-win through affiliate payouts.*",

          "body": "These are solid tactics. The \"play both sides\" one is sketchy but I've definitely seen it work in the wild.\n\nOne thing that's missing from this list that I've seen work repeatedly is **building in public with your actual users**, not just on Twitter.\n\nSet up a public feedback board and roadmap from day one. Let users see what others are requesting, vote on features, and track progress. This creates a growth loop where users share feature requests with their network, bringing in more users who have the same problems.\n\nIt's like community-driven growth but more authentic. Plus you get the benefit of social proof when potential customers see an active user base already engaged with your product. I built UserJot specifically for this and it's been one of my best growth channels. Users literally market for you when they share their feature requests.\n\nThe competitor scraping tactic is gold though. I'd add: monitor Reddit and Twitter for people complaining about your competitors. Those are the warmest leads you'll ever find. They already understand the problem and are actively looking for alternatives.\n\nFor the affiliate partnerships, what I've found works better than course creators is partnering with consultants and agencies. They're constantly looking for tools to recommend to clients and the LTV is way higher since they bring multiple accounts.\n\nAlso on selling outcomes first: this works but make sure you can actually deliver. Nothing kills momentum faster than refunding your first 10 customers because you oversold the dream.",

      "selftext": "The energy in this community is all about the brilliant, scrappy tactics to find product-market fit. We talk about building MVPs, leveraging APIs for automation, and creating referral loops that theoretically scale to infinity. It's all about building a better mousetrap and figuring out how to tell the world. But there's a critical, gritty transition phase that even the smartest plans often gloss over: the moment right after you launch but before you have any users. It's the \"cold start\" problem, and it's where most promising ideas quietly die.\n\nYou can have the most innovative product, a flawless landing page, and a targeted ad campaign, but if the first hundred visitors see zero social activity—no comments, no users, no signs of life, they will bounce. It’s a gut reaction. A product with no users is perceived as untested and unreliable. This isn't just a psychological barrier; it's a data point. High bounce rates and low time-on-site signal to algorithms (both ad platforms and search engines) that your offering is low-quality, making customer acquisition more expensive and organic discovery nearly impossible from day one.\n\nThe real growth hack isn't just building something people want; it's creating the illusion of momentum until you achieve genuine momentum. It's about hacking the perception of traction. This goes beyond just buying a few fake sign-ups. It's about strategically seeding your platform with activity that makes it look like a thriving community already exists. For a social app, this means having user profiles and interactions. For a content platform, it means having views, likes, and discussions on your initial posts. This initial layer of social proof is the lubricant that reduces the friction for your first real users to actually engage.\n\nThis requires a tactical, almost theatrical approach to staging your launch. The goal is to make your project look like it's already on its way, making it easier for real users to take the leap and join. Finding a service that can provide this foundational layer of realistic engagement is a crucial part of the modern growth hacker's toolkit. It's not the long-term strategy; it's the catalyst for the long-term strategy. In a recent project, using a platform like Viewtiful Day to generate initial user activity and content engagement was the decisive factor. It transformed the product's perception from a ghost town into a buzzing community, which dramatically improved the conversion rate of our paid traffic and, most importantly, triggered organic sharing because the first real users felt they were joining something active and valuable. Don't let a great product fail because you didn't hack the most important metric: the user's first impression.\n\n",

These skills determine your ability to get jobs, negotiate salaries, attract clients, and build relationships that create opportunities. Technical skills like coding, data analysis, or digital marketing become valuable quickly and remain relevant for years. Pick one technical area and go deep rather than sampling everything superficially. The combination of strong communication plus one technical specialty makes you extremely employable and entrepreneurially viable. Financial literacy gets overlooked but compounds massively over time. Understanding investing, business fundamentals, and personal finance at 20 creates decades of compounding advantages. Most people learn this too late to benefit from early wealth building opportunities. Avoid the trap of learning skills just because they're trendy. Focus on fundamentals that remain valuable regardless of technological changes - problem-solving, critical thinking, relationship building, and understanding how value gets created and captured in business.",

Want to get in shape? Don’t overthink it. Put your shoes on, walk out the door, etc…\n\n\t2.\tEngage in challenging conversations. Most people avoid conflict. Growth comes from leaning in. If something feels off, say it. Not rude, not aggressive, just honest. The convos you want to dodge are usually the ones that matter most.\n\n\t3.\tVanity metrics vs outcomes. Being busy doesn’t mean you’re being effective. Posting nonstop, grinding long hours, checking boxes… it might look productive, but does it actually move the needle? Focus on outcomes, not effort.\n\n\t4.\tThe art of compounding. The most underrated skill out there. Money, skills, relationships, habits—tiny actions stack up over time. Stay consistent, stay patient, and watch the curve bend in your favor.\n\nHope this is helpful…",

          "body": "Financial content on Instagram is tough as hell because of compliance restrictions and the fact that most people scroll social media to escape thinking about money, not get lectured about investments and budgeting.\n\nEducational content performs way better than promotional stuff for finance companies. Our clients consistently see more engagement with posts explaining financial concepts in simple terms rather than trying to pitch services. Think \"how compound interest actually works\" with visual examples instead of \"why you should invest with us.\"\n\nStory-driven content works too. Real customer success stories about paying off debt, buying first homes, or reaching savings goals get way more shares and comments than generic financial advice posts. Just make sure you have proper permissions and compliance approval for any customer stories.\n\nVisual content is crucial because financial topics are naturally boring. Charts, infographics, before-and-after debt payoff graphics, and simple animations explaining concepts perform better than text-heavy posts. Tools like Canva have tons of finance-focused templates that don't look amateur.\n\nTiming matters more for finance content than other industries. Post when people are thinking about money like Sunday evenings (planning for the week), Monday mornings (motivation), and around payday dates. Avoid posting during market crashes or negative financial news cycles.\n\nHashtag strategy needs to be specific. Generic tags like #finance or #money are useless because they're oversaturated. Use niche tags like #debtfreejourney, #firsttimehomebuyer, or #budgetingtips that actually reach people interested in those specific topics.\n\nCheck out accounts like u/thefinancialdiet, u/moneywithkatie, and u/debtfreecommunity for content inspiration. They nail the balance between educational and engaging without being overly salesy.\n\nThe biggest challenge is compliance. Every post probably needs legal review, which kills your ability to be timely and relevant. Make sure you understand what claims you can and can't make about financial products before creating content.\n\nEngagement comes from providing genuine value, not from growth hacks. Most finance companies fail on Instagram because they try to make boring topics go viral instead of just being consistently helpful.",

      "selftext": "Creating personas is supposed to help you understand your audience. But too many teams treat it like a box-ticking exercise and end up wasting time or building totally useless campaigns.\n\nHere are the 5 most common persona fails I still see:\n\n1. Making assumptions No data, no direction. Gut feelings ≠ insights. Use tools like GA, Clearbit, and even competitor research to build personas off real behavior not guesses.\n2. Getting lost in irrelevant details Nobody cares that your B2B audience \"loves ice cream.\" Focus on what matters: their goals, pain points, and buying triggers.\n3. Focusing on the person, not the need Demographics are fine, but needs drive action. What’s the pain? What motivates the purchase? What makes them hesitate? That's your gold.\n4. Creating too many personas You don’t need 8 different avatars. Focus on the core 1–3 that drive the most impact. Test, refine, iterate.\n5. Starting from scratch Already have users? Use them. Talk to them. Survey them. Analyze their behavior. That’s better than reinventing the wheel with “aspirational” personas.",

      "selftext": "Three months ago, I faced a problem every founder knows too well: **visibility and engagement on LinkedIn felt impossible**. I had a great product, a clear value proposition, but posting consistently felt like climbing a mountain every week. Some days I’d skip posts entirely, and my network barely noticed what I was building.\n\nI decided to experiment. I wanted to **see if AI could help me consistently share meaningful content** without losing my personal touch.\n\nHere’s what I did:\n\n1. **Mapped a 3-month content calendar** in one session. I included tips, micro-lessons from my startup journey, polls, and success stories from early users.\n2. **Used AI to draft initial post ideas and captions**, then personalized them with my voice. The key was never to post blindly, the AI was just a helper, not a replacement.\n3. **Engaged intentionally**. I spent 15–20 minutes daily responding to comments, connecting with thoughtful people, and following up on conversations sparked by posts.\n\nThe results? They surprised me:\n\n* Profile views **quadrupled**, leading to new inbound inquiries.\n* Connection requests increased 3x, many from potential clients or collaborators.\n* Several leads turned into paying customers **directly from LinkedIn conversations**.\n* Most importantly, I felt **less stressed about posting,** the automation handled planning, and I focused on engagement.\n\nThe biggest lesson I learned: **AI doesn’t replace human insight, it amplifies it**. By consistently showing value and being authentic, even small daily interactions compounded into meaningful growth.\n\nFor founders struggling with LinkedIn: think less about chasing every post or connection, and more about **building a credible, consistent presence**. Automation is your tool, your voice is still the magic.\n\n**TL;DR:** Using AI to plan and draft posts allowed me to focus on engagement and authentic interactions, 3 months later, my LinkedIn became a reliable channel for leads, connections, and growth.",

      "title": "How to spy on (and out-execute) your competitors' influencer campaigns—automatically",
      "selftext": "**The goal:** Stay one step ahead of rival brands by knowing every creator they partner with and every offer they test.\n\n**The challenge:** Influencer posts disappear fast in endless feeds, making competitive intel fragmentary at best.\n\n**The solution:** Glue together a few free data sources + light automation to put competitor influencer activity into a single living dashboard you can interrogate at any time.\n\n**Why use this approach?**\nInfluencer spend is still the most opaque line item in a marketing P&L. By reverse-engineering what's actually live in the feed creative angles, CTAs, promo codes you get early signals on funnels that eventually show up in paid ads months later. Act on those signals first and you win cheaper reach, better CAC, and a reputation for \"being everywhere\".\n\n**Step 1 — Catch every public post in real time.**\n• Set up a simple Mention + Zapier (or RSS + IFTTT) flow that watches Instagram/TikTok/YouTube for handles, hashtags, and even coupon prefixes your competitors typically use (e.g. \"BRAND20\").\n• Pipe the raw URLs into a Google Sheet; append timestamp, platform, and creator handle automatically.\n\n**Step 2 — Enrich with performance clues.**\n• Grab view counts & like counts via the free TikTok Creative Center API, YouTube oEmbed, or a lightweight scraper (keep requests low volume to stay TOS-friendly).\n• Add a column that flags spikes in views vs. each creator's baseline those are the angles resonating.\n\n**Step 3 — Overlay qualitative context.**\n• Once a week, scan G2/Trustpilot reviews for the same competitors; tag recurring pain points (\"pricing lock-in\", \"slow onboarding\").\n• Map which pain point each influencer video addresses. Patterns emerge quickly.\n\n**Step 4 — Turn intel into experiments.**\n• Choose one recurring hook (say, \"cancel anytime\") + one creator archetype (micro-tech reviewers with <50 k following).\n• Launch a 10-creator micro-test using any self-serve platform (I dog-food Marz for this, but manual outreach works too). Keep budget tight, CPM-based, and measure CAC/ROAS within a week.\n\n**Step 5 — Rinse, scale, and iterate.**\n• If a hook beats your control CAC by >20 %, double down: brief 50 more creators, raise spend, and roll the angle into your paid social.\n• If it flops, kill fast—your dashboard already has the next three insights queued.\n\nDoing this for a single competitor takes ~30 min to set up and <10 min a week to maintain. After a month you'll have a living map of the whole category's influencer playbook, ready to clone or counter-position.\n\nHope this helps anyone feeling left in the dark on influencer intel, happy to dig deeper into the sheets, APIs, or attribution if useful.",

It’s the byproduct of **real work, repeated until it looks easy.**\n\n👉 What do you think — is “passive income” a scam, or just badly branded hard work?",

Professional headshots, glowing quotes... the works. It looked so slick and credible.\n\nExcept it wasn't really converting.\n\nIn a fit of \"what the hell, let's try anything,\" I literally deleted the entire section and just embedded a single, slightly blurry screenshot of a customer's tweet. No fancy design, nothing. Just a raw, unfiltered compliment.\n\n**Conversions from the homepage went up 40%. FORTY.**\n\nMy perfectly designed feature got absolutely smoked by a five-minute copy-paste job. It was a total face-palm moment, but also a huge unlock. It taught me that authenticity is a wrecking ball.\n\nSo now I need to know I am not alone in this.\n\n**Hit me with yours.

We started with a broad idea of who we were building for, but the real magic happened when we looked at our earliest, most successful customers.\n\n\n\nWe basically asked:\n\nWho \"gets\" the product with the least amount of handholding?\n\nWho is using it in the most advanced ways?\n\nWho gives us the best feedback?\n\n\n\nAnswering those questions gave us a much sharper profile than any brainstorming session ever did. We also created an \"anti-ICP\" – profiles of customers who churned fast or were a massive support drain. Actively avoiding them is just as important as finding the right ones.\n\n\n\nCurious, did your ICP shift much from your initial idea after you got those first few thousand users?",

I would be 24x7 live on a Hubspot sales agent and as soon as I get new visitors, I will talk to them instantly and if they are up, I would ask them to come to a demo and then sign them up.\n\nAt that time also, AI-powered sales chatbots were there but I never use them. Why? Because it's just a beautiful AI-powered FAQ section. It can't give demos, it can't create sign up credentials for users, it can't give custom discount. It can't even convince users to really buy my product.\n\nBut why was I in so hurry for talking to visitors? Because timing matters. Suppose someone saw your Ad or ProductHunt launch or featured in Reddit post and then, they go to your website. They had some questions, asked your chatbot and just got answers, not solutions.\n\nSo they leave your website and go back to scrolling ProductHunt or Reddit.\n\nThis way, the identity you created in your ideal customer's mind, vanished within minutes.\n\nFor you, they are your potential users. For them, you are just another product that may or may not solve their problem.\n\nThat's why timing is important. Now, you can ask me any question you want, and I will answer it here.

It felt like I was spending more time switching between tools than actually growing accounts.\n\nA few months in, we were also trying out **Hygen** for **UGC-style** content, which helped generate raw ideas. But the real shift happened when we moved to **Indzu Social.** It combined everything we needed in one place, post-scheduling, caption + creative management, and even content creation (memes, carousels, short-form videos). That saved us hours every week and let us focus on growing accounts instead of managing chaos.\n\nFor services, we kept our focus clear:\n\n* Content creation (videos, memes, carousels)\n* Scheduling + posting\n* Analytics + reporting\n* Community engagement\n\nWithin a year, we grew from 3 small clients to 12 active ones, and our average website traffic went from 2K/month to 8.5K/month. Not an overnight success, but steady and sustainable growth.\n\nCurious to know what tools you are using to manage your social media platforms?",

Trigger it on PDP or at \\~40% scroll/exit intent, not on page load. Use responses to segment in Klaviyo, add dynamic PDP badges like “best for oily/acne,” auto-build bundles, and run retargeting that speaks to the stated concern. Measure quiz completion-to-purchase and CS ticket rate, not just signups. Typeform works for fast tests, Octane AI is solid on Shopify, and Pulse for Reddit helps me spot skincare threads and join when people ask for routine advice, which feeds better quiz questions.

      "title": "From $0 to $2.4k MRR with programmatic influencer campaigns (exact playbook inside)",
      "selftext": "Quick back-story: I was spending $120-$150/mo on Meta ads and seeing CACs north of $60, brutal for a $9/mo SaaS. Posts on LinkedIn? Crickets.\n\nSo I tried something totally different: I built a tiny script to recruit micro-creators, paid them performance-based, and automated the boring stuff (briefs, payouts, tracking). Ninety days later Marz hit $2.4k MRR with $0 ad spend.\n\nHere's why I think influencer marketing (done programmatically) is the most under-priced growth channel right now:\n\n1. **Ad auctions are saturated** – Meta CPMs +89% YoY, Google up every quarter. Creator shout-outs still sell for CPMs <$10 when you buy direct.\n2. **Organic virality is still alive** – TikTok & Reels reward fresh faces, not brands. Piggy-backing on a creator's feed gives you reach you can't buy.\n3. **AI & APIs finally make it scalable** – briefs, pricing, contracts, even script drafts can be generated in seconds, so you can work with 50 creators as easily as five.\n\nWant to try it? Here's the exact 10-step flow we used (steal it please):\n\n**Step 1: Pick ONE product & one KPI**\nChoose the feature you can demo in <30 sec and track it to a single URL or promo code. Ours was \"Launch influencer ads in 5 minutes.\" KPI = free-trial sign-ups.\n\n**Step 2: Nail your audience → influencer ICP**\nInstead of spray-and-pray, reverse-engineer: Who buys? What do they watch? For us: early-stage SaaS founders → follow indie-hacking, marketing TikTok, YouTube automation.\n\n**Step 3: Price with a dynamic CPM, not flat fees**\nCreators hate guessing rates, brands hate overpaying. We set a floor CPM of $8 and a bonus for conversions. (Simple Google Sheet works if you don't have software.)\n\n**Step 4: Automate your brief**\nTemplate → plug product, hook, CTA. GPT turns it into a 45-sec TikTok script. Time saved: ~30 min per creator.\n\n**Step 5: Use escrow / milestone payments**\nRelease 50% on draft approval, 50% once the post is live. Stripe Connect, Wise, or Mercury all have turnkey options.\n\n**Step 6: Launch a 5-creator pilot**\nTarget: 10k–30k combined followers each (nano + micro). Enough signal, low risk.\n\n**Step 7: Track real metrics, not likes**\nUTM links + a live dashboard: Views, Clicks, CTR, Sign-ups, CAC, ROAS. If you can't pull it in real time, a daily CSV works.\n\n**Step 8: Kill losers fast, double winners**\nPause any creator with CAC > target after 72h. Re-book the top 20% immediately and bump budget 2-3×.\n\n**Step 9: Pay creators fast**\nNothing builds goodwill like instant payouts. We release within 24h of post verification – zero follow-up emails from creators since.\n\n**Step 10: Common pitfalls to avoid**\n• Don't gift product instead of cash – you'll attract hobbyists.\n• Don't stuff multiple CTAs – one link only.\n• Don't wait weeks for drafts – set 48h turnaround.\n\n**Results from our first 90 days**\n• 127 videos live\n• 1.4M views / 38k clicks (2.7% CTR)\n• 411 trial sign-ups → 83 paying customers\n• Blended CAC: $7.90 (vs $62 on Meta)\n• Spend: $2,780 total to creators (paid from revenue, no ads)\n\nBiggest takeaway: treat influencer slots like ad inventory you can turn on/off with data, not like one-off brand deals.\n\nHope this helps anyone stuck in paid-ads hell.

You'll get feedback from a specific demographic that skews young, male, and tech-savvy. If your target market is small business owners or enterprise buyers, Reddit won't tell you shit about real demand.\n\nLanding pages aren't \"too complicated\" unless you're overthinking them. Throw up a simple page on Carrd or Webflow, describe your solution in plain English, and add an email signup. Drive traffic with $50 in Facebook or Google ads targeting basic keywords. Our clients validate demand this way in a week, not months.\n\nThe real mistake is avoiding direct conversations with potential customers. Not your friends, but strangers who actually have the problem you're trying to solve. Join industry forums, LinkedIn groups, Discord servers where your targets hang out. Ask questions about their pain points without pitching anything.\n\nPre-selling works incredibly well for demand validation. Put together a basic offer and see if people will actually pay money, not just say they're interested. Even if you refund everyone later, payment intent is the only validation metric that actually matters.\n\nYou can also analyze competitor demand signals. Look at their social media engagement, Glassdoor reviews mentioning problems, support forum complaints. If multiple companies are getting heat about the same issues, there's probably demand for a better solution.\n\nStop looking for the perfect validation method and just pick one. The worst thing is analysis paralysis that prevents you from learning anything at all.",

      "title": "From $0 to $2.4k MRR with programmatic influencer campaigns (exact playbook inside)",
      "selftext": "Quick back-story: I was spending $120-$150/mo on Meta ads and seeing CACs north of $60, brutal for a $9/mo SaaS. Posts on LinkedIn? Crickets.\n\nSo I tried something totally different: I built a tiny script to recruit micro-creators, paid them performance-based, and automated the boring stuff (briefs, payouts, tracking). Ninety days later Marz hit $2.4k MRR with $0 ad spend.\n\nHere's why I think influencer marketing (done programmatically) is the most under-priced growth channel right now:\n\n1. **Ad auctions are saturated** – Meta CPMs +89% YoY, Google up every quarter. Creator shout-outs still sell for CPMs <$10 when you buy direct.\n2. **Organic virality is still alive** – TikTok & Reels reward fresh faces, not brands. Piggy-backing on a creator's feed gives you reach you can't buy.\n3. **AI & APIs finally make it scalable** – briefs, pricing, contracts, even script drafts can be generated in seconds, so you can work with 50 creators as easily as five.\n\nWant to try it? Here's the exact 10-step flow we used (steal it please):\n\n**Step 1: Pick ONE product & one KPI**\nChoose the feature you can demo in <30 sec and track it to a single URL or promo code. Ours was \"Launch influencer ads in 5 minutes.\" KPI = free-trial sign-ups.\n\n**Step 2: Nail your audience → influencer ICP**\nInstead of spray-and-pray, reverse-engineer: Who buys? What do they watch? For us: early-stage SaaS founders → follow indie-hacking, marketing TikTok, YouTube automation.\n\n**Step 3: Price with a dynamic CPM, not flat fees**\nCreators hate guessing rates, brands hate overpaying. We set a floor CPM of $8 and a bonus for conversions. (Simple Google Sheet works if you don't have software.)\n\n**Step 4: Automate your brief**\nTemplate → plug product, hook, CTA. GPT turns it into a 45-sec TikTok script. Time saved: ~30 min per creator.\n\n**Step 5: Use escrow / milestone payments**\nRelease 50% on draft approval, 50% once the post is live. Stripe Connect, Wise, or Mercury all have turnkey options.\n\n**Step 6: Launch a 5-creator pilot**\nTarget: 10k–30k combined followers each (nano + micro). Enough signal, low risk.\n\n**Step 7: Track real metrics, not likes**\nUTM links + a live dashboard: Views, Clicks, CTR, Sign-ups, CAC, ROAS. If you can't pull it in real time, a daily CSV works.\n\n**Step 8: Kill losers fast, double winners**\nPause any creator with CAC > target after 72h. Re-book the top 20% immediately and bump budget 2-3×.\n\n**Step 9: Pay creators fast**\nNothing builds goodwill like instant payouts. We release within 24h of post verification – zero follow-up emails from creators since.\n\n**Step 10: Common pitfalls to avoid**\n• Don't gift product instead of cash – you'll attract hobbyists.\n• Don't stuff multiple CTAs – one link only.\n• Don't wait weeks for drafts – set 48h turnaround.\n\n**Results from our first 90 days**\n• 127 videos live\n• 1.4M views / 38k clicks (2.7% CTR)\n• 411 trial sign-ups → 83 paying customers\n• Blended CAC: $7.90 (vs $62 on Meta)\n• Spend: $2,780 total to creators (paid from revenue, no ads)\n\nBiggest takeaway: treat influencer slots like ad inventory you can turn on/off with data, not like one-off brand deals.\n\nHope this helps anyone stuck in paid-ads hell.

          "body": "The cofounder search is definitely challenging but you're taking the right approach by being specific about what you need. From my experience building multiple startups, finding the right technical cofounder is less about their coding abilities and more about finding someone who's genuinely excited about the problem you're solving. The best partnerships happen when both people are equally invested in the market opportunity, not just their respective skill sets.\n\nOne thing I'd suggest is being a bit more open geographically if possible - limiting yourself to just Bhubaneswar might really narrow your options. Remote partnerships can work really well these days, especially in the early stages. You might also want to consider starting with freelance developers through platforms like Twine to build an MVP first, then bringing on a technical cofounder once you have some traction. Sometimes it's much easier to attract quality cofounders when there's already momentum and proof of concept rather than just an idea.",

Y Combinator has some great resources on this. The real test isn't when things are going great, but how you both handle a crisis when everything's on fire.

      "selftext": "Most people in ecommerce obsess over discount pop-ups: “10% off your first order” plastered everywhere. The problem is they’re generic and usually ignored.\n\nI tested something different on one of my stores. Instead of offering a blanket discount, we created a micro-offer that matched the product category. Example: for a skincare store, instead of “10% off,” the popup said:\n\n“Want to know exactly how often you should reorder \\[product\\]? Enter your email and get a personalised schedule.”\n\nIt wasn’t sexy. It was basically a simple guide tied to our product usage. But the results shocked me:\n\n* Opt-in rate went from \\~3.5% to \\~5% (42% lift).\n* Emails collected were way more engaged and open rates on follow-ups jumped from 21% to 34%.\n* Repeat purchase cycle shortened, because the content naturally drove them back when they were due.\n\nThe takeaway: relevance beats blanket discounts. By making the opt-in useful *before* someone even bought, the growth loop pulled them deeper instead of just bribing them.\n\nCurious to hear from others here: what’s been your highest-performing “non-discount” lead magnet experiment?",

      "title": "How to increase SaaS trial conversions & improve key SaaS growth metrics (full process breakdown)",
      "selftext": "**TLDR;** The answer is automated lifecycle email and in-app messages triggered when users take certain actions within your app to guide them to the next stage of the user journey. Process breakdown below.\n\nWhen done correctly, this can increase activation rate, retention, conversion rate AND reduce churn - improving all KPIs that boost your SaaS valuation.\n\n**The system (4 steps):**\n\n**1. Track everything with a CDP.** Connect all your SaaS user data sources to track every action. Some that I like: RudderStack, PostHog, Segment, amplitude (has some CDP-like features). CDPs allow you to create a unified customer view where you learn your users key drop off points - crucial for product led growth.\n\n**2. Connect to email platform.** Link to your chosen email marketing platform - my favorite email marketing platforms for SAAS are; Loops so, Customer io & Encharge. Segment users based on actions and current stage. Audience segments are constantly updated via API.\n\n**3. Deploy these 9 core flows.** Value-focused multi-step flows to guide users to the next stage. Not spam - only triggered by what they have/haven't done.\n\n* **Welcome** \\- Coach to first \"Aha!\" moment (Trigger: Account created)\n* **Onboarding** \\- Feature education tied to use-case (Trigger: Key milestone/action completed)\n* **No-Login** \\- Re-engage silent users (Trigger: No login for n days)\n* **Gamification/Progress** \\- Celebrate wins, create momentum (Trigger: Task completion)\n* **Feature Limitation** \\- Highlight premium features (Trigger: Gated feature attempt/ tokens limit reached/near)\n* **Referral** \\- Turn users into advocates (Trigger: Activation milestone)\n* **Cancellation** \\- Rescue at-risk accounts (Trigger: Viewed cancellation page x times)\n* **Abandoned Payment** \\- Recover failed checkouts (Trigger: Checkout started & not completed)\n* **Payment Declined** \\- Prevent involuntary churn (Trigger: Charge failed)\n\nThere will be more flows that are unique to your app though these 9 apply to the majority of SaaS. Other examples of flows you might want to implement to drive product led growth are; testimonial/review request flow, user feedback/survey flow and feature request flows.\n\n*note - I am currently offering free custom email flow planning + writing for qualified SaaS companies*\n\n**4. A/B test and optimize.** Test messaging at every stage. Route data to dashboards showing which emails drive upgrades and how key SaaS growth metrics improve.\n\n**Example - Simple math to show potential impact:**  \nLet's say you have 100 trial signups → 40% activate → 15% of those convert = 6 paying customers\n\nIf your automated flows boost activation by 20 points: 100 signups → 60% activate → 15% convert = 9 customers (50% increase)\n\nAt scale:  \n1,000 signups: 60 vs 90 paid users  \n10,000 signups: 600 vs 900 paid users\n\n*Note: I'm using 15% activation-to-paid conversion which is conservative - many SaaS see higher rates with proper flows. the purpose of this example is to show the value of increasing activation rates using this system*\n\nAs your product scales, this lever will provide more significant results. This example doesn't touch on other crucial benefits such as; churn reduction, improved feature adoption, higher retention, and increased engagement throughout the customer lifecycle.\n\n**When this works best:** When you have reached product-market fit and have a consistent user acquisition channel where small improvements will begin to compound fast at scale.\n\nI've compiled 500+ real email examples from successful SaaS companies across these flow types (as well as other flow/campaign types) - might be helpful when planning your own flows/emails. let me know if you would like it.",

Getting those lifecycle emails dialed in is a total game-changer for SaaS.\n\n\n\nOne other piece that fits really nicely with this, especially for the \"Welcome\" and \"Onboarding\" flows, is having instant, in-app support. We've all been there – you hit a snag trying to figure out a new tool and waiting for an email reply is enough friction to make you just close the tab.\n\n\n\nfull disclosure, i work at eesel AI. We see a lot of our SaaS customers plugging an AI chatbot into their onboarding to solve this exact problem. It's a pretty low-effort way to give users instant answers right when they're trying to find that \"Aha!\" moment. You can get one up and running fast just by pointing it at your existing help center docs. Companies like Rise Vision use it to handle those common new-user questions, which helps keep people from dropping off during that critical trial period.\n\n\n\nAnyway, great post! The impact on activation from a tight system like this is huge.",

          "body": "hey, this is one of those 'how long is a piece of string' questions because the benchmarks can vary wildly depending on a few key things.\n\n\n\nWhat channels are you planning to use? Google Ads, social media, affiliates? And which countries are you targeting? A CPL for a lead in a Tier 1 country like the US or UK will be massively different from a Tier 3 country.\n\n\n\nGenerally speaking, the finance/forex space is notoriously competitive, so CPLs can be on the higher side. I've seen them range from $40 to well over $150 depending on the quality and source of the traffic.\n\n\n\nFor CVR from click to signup, a benchmark could be anywhere from 2% to 8%. It really depends on how compelling your landing page is, the offer you're presenting, and how targeted your traffic is. If you're just sending cold traffic to a generic homepage, you'll be on the low end. If it's a dedicated landing page with a strong call-to-action, you can definitely aim for the higher end of that range.\n\n\n\nYour best bet is probably to start with a small test budget to figure out your own baseline and then optimize from there.

For compliant scale, set up ManyChat comment keyword + story reply flows so users opt in (“Comment ‘guide’ and I’ll DM the checklist”), and deliver value there. Skip mass tagging; reply to their comment, or run giveaways with a max “tag 1 friend,” or collab posts with micro-creators. Track everything in Airtable; use Zapier to queue follow-ups 48h after a reply.

Scraping followers and mass DMing/mentioning is a fast track to getting your account flagged or even permanently suspended, so you have to tread really carefully.\n\n\n\nMost of the big, reputable platforms have moved away from these features because they're against the terms of service. The tools that still offer it are often in a grey area and can be unreliable, just like you found with Secsers.\n\n\n\nI've heard of some tools specifically for this, like Cold DMs, that focus on the automatic outreach part. But even with a tool like that, you have to be super careful. The key is to make it look as \"manual\" as possible low volume, highly personalized messages, and warm up the account slowly. If you just blast out hundreds of mentions or DMs in a day, you'll get shut down almost immediately.\n\n\n\nHonestly, a safer (though more time-consuming) strategy might be to focus on engagement. Instead of scraping a list, you could manually identify and engage with a handful of high-value accounts in your niche each day. It's slower, but it's a much more sustainable way to grow without risking your account.\n\n\n\nGood luck with the project",

If you're building a dev tool or something for other founders, great. But if you're building accounting software or a fitness app, you're just shouting into the void.\n\nThe builders following your journey aren't your customers. They're interested in your tech stack and revenue numbers, not actually using your product.\n\nA better approach is to build in public WITH your actual users instead of TO other builders. Set up a public feedback board and roadmap where your real users can see what you're working on and influence the direction. Share updates through a changelog that your customers actually care about.\n\nThis way you get the benefits of transparency and community building, but with the people who matter: your users. They submit ideas, vote on features, see progress, get notified when their requests ship. That's real building in public.\n\nI use UserJot for this (I also built it for this exact reason). Your users can see your roadmap, submit feedback, and get updates when you ship their requests. Way more valuable than getting likes from other founders who will never use your product.\n\nWhat's your app about? That really determines whether traditional build in public makes sense for you.",

The software you use hasn’t features you need and you want to contribute.\n5. Network with other developers.\n\nHaving your goal clear helps you identify the project or community to work with. First i’d suggest to see if the software you use is open source and if you like contributing, that could be a first step. \nOnce you identify the project, understand how maintainers work: how do they share information? How do they track bugs? How do their pull request look like?\nThen get started. Don’t ask for permission. Pick a bug and publish a pull request. be patient, maintainers are very busy. \n\nStart small, so that 1/ you have hire chance of success 2/ you’ll find quickly if you like it or not.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been working with Manychat since 2019, built and automated hundrads of flows, sent over 500k messages and generated tens of thousands of visitors. Through this time I noticed that chat funnels behave totally diferent than the classic landing page style.\n\n1.. Psychology\nMost people dont buy with logic. Decisions are driven by small triggers like curiosity, scarcity, the feeling of winning, or just making the journey fun instead of heavy. Short and simple questions keep people moving without resistance.\n\n2.. CRO\nEvery word inside the flow matters. The CTA must look like the obvious next step, not a sales pitch. I’ve seen how changing the order of one question or even one word in the copy can boost conversions by 30%+.\n\n3.. Gamification\nAdding a small playful element like a random draw, quiz or challenge suddnly makes people excited to complete the funnel. This alone doubled results compared to boring landing pages.\n\nThe main lesson for me: chat funnels work because they mirror how humans actually make choicesthrough conversation, curiosity and a bit of play. If you build funnels without psychology, CRO and gamification, you are missing the real leverage...\n\nAnyone here tested shifting traffic from landing pages to conversational funnels? what did you see?",

          "body": "Reddit has always been hostile to promotional content, but users are definitely more savvy about spotting marketing attempts now. You're probably coming across as too salesy instead of being genuinely helpful first.\n\nThe academic research community is particularly skeptical of outsiders trying to sell them tools because they get pitched constantly by software companies who don't understand their actual workflow. Your approach is probably screaming \"vendor trying to make money\" instead of \"fellow researcher sharing something useful.\"\n\nHere's what you're doing wrong: you're leading with your product instead of leading with value. Our clients who succeed on Reddit spend months building credibility in communities before they ever mention their own tools. They answer questions, share insights, participate in discussions about research methodology problems.\n\nThe systematic review space has tons of existing tools like Covidence, Rayyan, and others, so people are tired of hearing about new solutions unless they solve specific problems the existing tools don't handle. You need to establish yourself as someone who genuinely understands systematic review pain points, not just another app developer.\n\nStop posting about your app directly and start helping people with their actual research problems. Answer questions about methodology, share tips about search strategies, comment helpfully on posts about review challenges. After months of being a valuable community member, then you can casually mention that you built something to solve specific issues you've been discussing.\n\nThe \"fuck off\" responses happen because people can sense when someone joins a community just to promote their stuff. Reddit users hate feeling like they're being used as a marketing channel by people who don't actually participate in the community.\n\nBuild genuine relationships first, then share your solution as part of ongoing conversations about research challenges. Way more effective than drive-by promotional posts.",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I just found a hack some companies use to blow up their LinkedIn pages with likes from their exact ICP.\n\nImagine you’re running a SaaS targeting executives at $50M+ companies. Normally it’s really hard to get that audience to follow your page. And yet some pages have 10k, 20k, even 50k followers even though they barely post content and offer no incentive.\n\nI always wondered how they were doing it.\n\nHere’s the trick. When you post a job opening from your LinkedIn page, anyone who applies is automatically prompted to follow the page as part of the LinkedIn flow.\n\nWhat many companies do is create dozens of fake job listings. These attract hundreds or even thousands of applicants and instantly boost their page followers.\n\nI tested it myself. Within minutes, dozens of people followed my company page. It works.\n\nBut the downside is that you waste candidates’ time. Some applicants were sending custom videos and carefully tailored resumes for jobs that didn’t even exist. That’s when I deleted the job post. It felt wrong.\n\nStill, the hack is repeatable. In theory you could create 100 fake job posts and flood your page with followers. Some even scrape emails from the applicants.\n\nPersonally I don’t like this approach because it feels abusive. But in the first comment I’ll share something more useful. You can extract your competitors’ page followers. These are people in your ICP who already know your competitors, either because they liked their page or applied to their jobs. Fresh leads without wasting anyone’s time.\n\nTake this hack however you want. Even if you use the fake job method, I won’t judge.\n\nCheers !",

      "selftext": "\\*\\*Hi,\n\nDear community, I have a problem with the 30-day trial version of a certain program. I can’t find this program anywhere because it’s not very popular.\n\nThe program is protected by a solution from CRYPTLEX. After installation, I have 30 days of a free period (a time-limited version). During this time the whole program is in the full version. After that time the program becomes inactive.\n\nI figured out myself that this program is protected by Cryptlex. If I reinstall Windows and this program, then again I will have 30 days of the trial version, but it makes no sense to install a new system every 30 days. Therefore, I have questions:\n\n 1. how does the Cryptlex protection work? I suppose that the program saves somewhere the start date of the license – maybe in the Windows registry or somewhere else?  \n2. how to find this place and where is it located?  \n3. I will look for the file cryptlex activator.dll myself and probably it is there?  \n4. is there anyone here who is an expert in Cryptlex protection? I suppose that it is possible to make a patch that would renew the license if the 30 days pass.  \n5. If someone were able to help, I would be grateful – or if someone has already done it before :)  \n6. Are there any online forums where people knowledgeable about this hang out? I’ve searched the whole internet and can’t really find anything specific...  \n7. The “SOFT98” forum looks interesting, but I’m having trouble navigating the site – does anyone know this site well and could assist me? Maybe the guys from Soft98 would be able to help?\n\nThanks in advance for the tips.",

      "title": "The biggest lie in marketing: \"best practices\"",
      "selftext": "Hey growth, marketing, and conversion funnel experts!\n\nLet's talk about the biggest lie in marketing: \"best practices.\" That standard pricing template you're using? It's probably costing you.\n\nOne of the reasons we keep seeing the same types of offers is that everyone is just using the same template. We assume that if \"X\" is doing it, \"I should too\" or \"it must be working for them.\"\n\nWhen you're selling a product to so many different personas, it's obvious there are different prices for different pain points. But is this the only way to present it? Can we try something different?\n\nThink about games like **Fortnite, Clash of Clans, or even Candy Crush**. They let you help them define the price you see in the app—how? Through personalization. The moment they see you've tried or looked at the more expensive product (for example, a $0.99 bundle with 10,000 coins versus a $20 bundle with a million coins), they understand you fall into the highest-value segment. And guess what? The next time you log in, you'll forever see offers of $20 and up—until you buy the $100 pack. This has been working since before AI. I even built it myself 🤖.\n\nAnd what about non-gaming apps? They'll always show you two offers: monthly or yearly. On top of that price, they'll offer you additional add-ons to expand the product.\n\nAnd, of course, my favorite of all: combining several worlds with the **Freemium model**, which some of our friends (like Canva, for example) have already figured out. I can identify your extensive usage and know how to offer you prices that are a good fit for you, whether you're a \"pro\" or not.\n\nSo, **what is the right plan for you?** We can figure it out together.",

Saves scrambling through dashboards.\n\n\nMonthly executive brief - a simple one-pager that shows what actually moved the needle this month without me crunching numbers manually.\n\n\nSimilar for SEO tasks like seo reports, rankings,.site audit etc..\n\n\n\n\nNone of these are “sexy” features, but they would free up hours and keep marketing teams focused on strategy instead of detective work.",

      "selftext": "So back in Jan, 2025, I joined a very celebrated VC in Mumbai as a founding partner to set up their micro-VC chapter focused on backing young founders (recent grads, still in college, etc). I ran it for about 8 months.\n\nDuring this time, I was dedicating my weekends with a friend (now my co-founder) to ship projects and MVPs to understand how early-stage really works and what impact capital really carries.\n\nBy this time only, I had this insight that the voice-AI market is growing super fast and there's enough room to build something people want in this space.\n\nSo, I got 2 more devs to work on this, built a scratchy MVP and started giving more time to it.\n\nNow, by July-August, I was feeling this Bruce Wayne-Batman duality and I really wanted to focus on one thing. I left the job to only focus on this.\n\nA week ago, we built the MVP. It took about 2 months to build and the tech was decent. Just the placement and marketing efforts were weak.\n\nWe placed the product as a hands-free AI sales agent to boost website conversion.\n\nAnd it didn’t rank at all. I talked to many people but most were uninterested.\n\nSo here I was, wondering how I could be wrong with my insights. I had even faced this first hand earlier when building Sttabot AI.\n\nAfter failing badly in the launch, I found one possible reason. The problem we were solving was not resonating with potential customers. In today’s sea of tools, people really want something they can instantly relate to. The pain points should strike at first glance.\n\nThat’s why I am changing the vision.\n\nI have this hypothesis that I want feedback on. Even with automation workflows, there’s no single agent that can do end-to-end sales without a human in the loop. The idea is an intelligent, autonomous sales agent that manages the complete sales cycle.\n\nNot just finding prospects, sending mails, or cold calling. But agents with computer-use capabilities that can talk to website visitors, scroll and demo your platform for them, find best deals, collect payments, and onboard users.\n\nAnything sales you can think of, taken care of by an autonomous AI agent with computer-use capability.\n\nI would really like to hear some critical feedback on this. Where do you see gaps? What would make this genuinely useful in practice?",

          "body": "Marketing. Product Market Fit.\n\n\"...single agent that can do end-to-end sales without a human in the loop. The idea is an intelligent, autonomous sales agent that manages the complete sales cycle.\" You are assuming there is a market for this. You assume that this is desired. \n\nMy personal take is this: An ideal sales rep with good tools is going to achieve a cost of customer acquisition of x. But more than that, there is a limit to how many leads I can acquire (my TAM) and a cost curve for how fast I can get those leads (think of the way that Google prices clicks). Leads cost more the more you have to feed the sales machine. Want more leads? Cost per lead goes up.\n\nIf I have an AI agent, I can process leads faster and more of them per month but the cost of those leads becomes much higher. If I process the same number of leads that I do today but with a lower cost agent vs. human, intuitively I believe my close rate will be lower and my organization is operationally optimized for y number of sales, at least, per month. So I don't want fewer sales at a somewhat lower CAC. Additionally, the cost to set up the agent to my top team is huge and it includes the decision maker so you are making more work for the decision maker.\n\nIf my TAM is huge and my cost of leads is flat then I am already using automated tools most likely so you have to displace an incumbent but that is the characteristics of what you might want to look for. These are ideal cases.\n\nSo, if I think about all of these variables, my head aches!\n\nIn my opinion, you need to master one or a few verticals to show case studies and then market at things like trade shows to you can get to decision makers. Typical \"SaaS' growth hacking isn't going to put you in front of a decision maker running a big organization. Why would be at a serious company wanting to do a serious trial and spend all that setup? They would contact someone like Accenture or someone like that to do the heavy lifting.",

Imagine a company trying to sell you something and not even bothering to give you a human to human interaction. I have been getting these calls for the last 2-3 months. I know in 5 seconds that this is a bot. Click. That's it. Try to come on the other side of your product. If a robot was to call you now to sell you a new car, would you talk to it for 15 minutes? Try to do it. See what it's like. I am not a customer and don't foresee buying from a company that won't even employ a human sales guy to talk to me - a human customer. Just my two cents. I'd say cut your losses unless you're able to raise big rounds where you can encash out partially. Then, hire the most aggressive sales guys to stuff it down customer's throats. You know which ones? Commodities. Insurance, Banks, Telecom, etc, etc. Pitch it as an alternative to adsense. Why pay $10 per click if you can get 100 calls to customers for $10. Maybe, just maybe it'll work.",

J’ai démarré dans un marché pilote émergent : le Maroc. Résultat : plus de 100 clients signés en un an, avec une traction encourageante.\n\nLe produit peut être utilisé partout dans le monde, mais l’Europe est un marché beaucoup plus mature, avec des acteurs solides comme Zenchef, qui y dispose d’une forte présence et d’une image de référence.\n\nJe me pose deux grandes questions :\n\n1. Est-il pertinent de se mesurer à un acteur dominant comme Zenchef en Europe ? → Mes réflexions : être plus compétitif sur le prix, offrir une qualité équivalente, et cibler deux segments précis : les nouveaux restaurants qui ouvrent et les restaurateurs insatisfaits des solutions existantes.\n2. Si vous étiez à ma place, quelle stratégie de prospection mettriez-vous en place pour pénétrer un marché aussi mature ?\n\nVos avis, conseils ou retours me seraient très utiles. Merci d’avance à ceux qui prendront le temps de répondre !",

          "body": "Your 18% conversion increase claim sounds impressive, but I'd be curious about your sample size and testing duration. Most CRO \"wins\" people share on social media aren't statistically significant or don't hold up over longer time periods.\n\nThat said, CTA optimization can definitely move the needle when done properly. Our clients typically see the biggest gains from changing button copy rather than colors. Switching from generic \"Submit\" or \"Learn More\" to something specific like \"Get My Free Quote\" or \"Start My Trial\" usually outperforms visual tweaks.\n\nThe psychological principle behind effective CTA changes is reducing friction and anxiety. People convert better when they know exactly what happens after they click, and when the button text matches their mental state. \"Buy Now\" feels pushy, but \"Secure My Spot\" feels exclusive.\n\nLocation matters more than color most of the time. Moving your CTA above the fold or adding a second one at the bottom of longer pages typically has bigger impact than testing different shades of blue versus orange.\n\nHeadline changes can be way more dramatic than button tweaks though. Our clients who test value proposition focused headlines against feature focused ones often see 30-50% differences. Most people obsess over button colors when their headline doesn't clearly communicate why someone should care.\n\nThe mistake most people make is testing random elements instead of focusing on the biggest conversion barriers first. Test your value proposition, then your CTA copy, then worry about colors and fancy design elements.\n\nSingle element tests work, but the real gains come from understanding why people aren't converting and addressing those specific objections systematically.",

The \"hammer when we need a screwdriver\" and \"baking a cake with only a whisk\" analogies feel forced as hell.\n\nIf you actually want useful tool recommendations, be specific about what problems you're trying to solve instead of asking for generic B2B tools. \"Managing customer relationships\" could mean anything from basic contact tracking to complex enterprise account management.\n\nHere's what actually works for our clients: HubSpot for companies that need all-in-one CRM, marketing automation, and sales pipeline management. It's expensive but worth it if you use multiple features. Pipedrive is solid for straightforward sales tracking without the bloat. Intercom handles customer communication way better than most CRM chat features.\n\nFor lead tracking specifically, most companies overthink this shit. A simple CRM with proper tagging and pipeline stages works better than complex lead scoring systems that nobody actually uses. The key is consistent data entry, not fancy features.\n\nMarketing automation tools like Mailchimp or ConvertKit work fine for basic email sequences, but if you're doing serious B2B marketing, you need something that integrates properly with your CRM. Too many companies use disconnected tools and wonder why their data is a mess.\n\nThe biggest mistake is trying to find one perfect tool that does everything. Our clients who succeed pick 2-3 solid tools that integrate well together instead of searching for some magical all-in-one solution that doesn't exist.\n\nYou need to identify the specific business process you're actually trying to improve. That'll get you better recommendations than asking for generic B2B tools.",
