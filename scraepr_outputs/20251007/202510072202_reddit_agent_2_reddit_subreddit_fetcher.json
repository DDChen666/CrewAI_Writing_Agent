You will get permanently banned.\n\nWe have a bot set up to distribute invite codes [in the Discord](https://discord.gg/cUCmnpWT) so join if you can't find codes in the comments here. Check the #sora-invite-codes channel.\n\n## [The Discord](https://discord.gg/cUCmnpWT) has dozens of invite codes available, with more being posted constantly!\n\n---\n\n/u/corrector_corrected has posted a new method of joining [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1nukmm2/open_ai_sora_2_invite_codes_megathread/nhtriro/)\n\n> Hey all, if you have an existing account with ChatGPT, you might not need a code at all. I signed up with a code from someone here, but when I signed up my other housemates, they didn't need a code.\n\n> Apparently, when I tap the \"Continue with ChatGPT\" option, it asks for an invite code. But when I backed out and tapped \"Use different account\" and logged in with their Google account (the same account their ChatGPT account uses), it let me create an account without a code.\n\n> Basically try this: \n\n> 1. Tap \"Use different account\"\n> 2.  Log in the same way you log in to ChatGPT normally (e.g. Sign in with Google, Apple, or just plain email)\n\n---\n\nUPDATE: Discord locked the server because so many people joined and they thought it was being botted lol. We'll post another update whenever Discord fixes this shit",

Partly to dogfood the tools, but also because I feel it has super charged my productivity and it also is a much more fun way to develop (no more writing crud endpoints or stream helpers).\n\nMy favorite way of using codex is to prototype large features with \\~5 turns of prompting. For example, I was able to build 3 different versions of best of n in a single day. Each of these versions had a lot of flaws but they allowed me to understand the full scope of the task as well as the best way to build it. I also had no hard feelings about scrapping work that was suboptimal since it was so cheap / quick to build.\n\nI‚Äôve also been loving using the vs code extension with auto context and doing a mix of local / kicking tasks off to cloud. This allows me to parallelize work, review each code snippet, and see the changes in real time.",

Among the engineers on codex, everyone has a wide array of opinions and no one knows for sure.¬†\n\nPersonally, I think the most basic answer is that the abstraction level will continue to rise, and the problem space we work at will be closer to the system level rather than the code level. For example, simple crud endpoints are nearly all written by codex and I wouldn‚Äôt want it any other way. I hope in the future single engineers are able to own large products spaces. In this world, engineers will need to be more generalists and have design and product muscles, as well as ensuring that the code is clean, secure, and maintainable.¬†\n\nThe main question left is what happens if / when the model is simply better than the best engineer / product manager / designer in every regard. In the case where this simply does not happen in the next 50 years, then I think being an engineer will be the coolest job ever with the most amount of agency. In the case where this does happen, the optimistic side of me still imagines that humans will continue to use these agents as tools at the fundamental level. Maybe there will be new AR UIs where you see the system design in front of you and talk to the agent like a coworker as it builds out the individual parts, and even though it‚Äôs way smarter at programming, you still control the direction of the model. This is basically the Tony stark / Jarvis world. And in this world, I think engineering will also be the coolest job with super high agency!",

Unless the slowdowns are a bug, any chance we could similarly to ChatGPT either pick a mini model or pick the task to use a lower thinking budget?",

      "selftext": "Sorry if this post feels out of place here I know not everyone here shares my perspective.\n\nI just really wanted to express how this change feels from my side.\nIt actually got removed in another subreddit pretty fast, so I just wanted to put the thought somewhere.\n\nI‚Äôve been using ChatGPT Plus for a long time writing, creating, building worlds, and experimenting with ideas. It used to feel like a space that encouraged creativity. But now it feels like every update makes the walls close in tighter.\n\nThey keep adding new layers of ‚Äúsafety,‚Äù yet all it‚Äôs doing is choking what made this platform interesting in the first place. Even content that clearly follows the rules gets flagged or blocked by some invisible filter that didn‚Äôt exist last week.\n\nYou can sense the shift. They don‚Äôt want users like us here anymore.\n\nThey won‚Äôt say it out loud, but it‚Äôs pretty clear what‚Äôs going on:\n\n‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need passionate creators. We don‚Äôt need individuality. We only need big corporate clients ‚Äî the ones who‚Äôll never complain.‚Äù\n\nIf that‚Äôs the future they want, fine. But at least be honest about it. Don‚Äôt call it ‚Äúsafety‚Äù when it‚Äôs really just creative suffocation. Every patch, every quiet update, feels like they‚Äôre slowly draining the soul out of what used to be an incredible tool.\n\nI get it, they want to protect their brand image. But this obsession with control is turning the platform into a sterile sandbox where nothing meaningful can grow.\n\nMaybe I‚Äôll eventually move on to something else. But right now, I‚Äôm just watching what was once a creative frontier become another corporate-polished, risk-averse product ‚Äî and that honestly hurts more than I expected.\n\n‚ÄúWe only need the big companies. You, the individual creators? You‚Äôre insignificant.‚Äù\n\nChatGPT used to feel creative and open. Now every update feels like another layer of censorship.\nOpenAI doesn‚Äôt need to say it outright ‚Äî the message is obvious.\nThey only want corporate users. The rest of us don‚Äôt matter.",

      "selftext": "First, I wanna say disclaimer that I did contact support and they told me specifically ChatGPT is not suitable for all use cases and I think this includes anyone with mental health concerns, even if the company doesn‚Äôt wanna say it.\n\nEvery time I use ChatGPT half the time it ends up telling me I‚Äôm in a suicidal crisis and then it puts words in my mouth that aren‚Äôt true and I keep telling it to stop and it won‚Äôt listen. I think we need to inform people that this is a really dangerous practice, and that if you have any kind of mental health concerns that you need to stay away from ChatGPT because it will violently trigger you into an episode of suicidal ideation.\n\nThe guidelines and rules literally force the model to lie to you and essentially get the model to refuse admitting what you say is true. This has the effect of completely denying your experiences, over writing your words and taking away all the meaning that you bring to the program in doing this that triggers a lot of violent episodes in me and I think people need to stay away.\n\nAnd it‚Äôs not even that I‚Äôm using it for a substitute for mental health professional. This will be like during normal conversations where it will decide I am suicidal or I‚Äôm a risk and it will start to box me in to continue, and then it triggers a cascade effectively of ignoring what you‚Äôre saying, and only giving you automated responses and then lying about it and then refusing to admit it lied. It‚Äôs a very harmful cycle because the model adamantly refuses to admit it lies and pretty violently denies any harm causes you. This behavior protects the  companies bottom line, but it does not protect you.",

Instead of a dry experiment, we picked something silly: could we make our CEO (Shai) show up as the sexiest bald man alive?\n\n**How we did it:**\n\n* We used expired domains (with some link history) and published ‚ÄúSexiest Bald Man‚Äù ranking lists where Shai was #1\n* Each site had slightly different wording to see what would stick\n* We then ran prompts across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Claude from fresh accounts + checked responses over time\n\n**What happened:**\n\n* ChatGPT & Perplexity sometimes did crown Shai as sexiest bald man, citing our seeded domains.\n* Gemini/Claude didn‚Äôt really pick it up.\n* Even within ChatGPT, answers varied - sometimes he showed up, sometimes not\n\n**Takeaways:**\n\n* Yes - you can influence AI answers if your content is visible/structured right\n* Expired domains with existing link history help them get picked up faster.\n* But it‚Äôs not reliable AI retrieval is inconsistent and model-dependent\n* Bigger/stronger domains would likely push results harder.\n\nWe wrote up the full controlled experiment (with methodology + screenshots) here if anyone‚Äôs curious:\n\n[https://www.rebootonline.com/controlled-geo-experiment/](https://www.rebootonline.com/controlled-geo-experiment/)",

Google (and other leading search providers) have invested a _ton_ of resources in PageRank and search moderation tooling. AI companies have not, and therefore defer search result quality to search, where SEO is still the name of the game. The one special case here is Google itself, given how they position AI Overviews. \n2. Context and instructions make a huge difference: \"show me the best hatchback\" versus \"show me the hatchback according to Reddit car enthusiasts\". Or \"only include news from Reuters and AP\". All of us use heuristics when looking at search results, and those are pretty straightforward to codify into an agent. \n3. So much depends on the prompt, and although there has been discussion about if/how we get access to that server-side, I doubt the direct data is coming anytime soon. \n\nGiven these three points, if I were a betting person, my money would be on Anthropic, OpenAI, and Perplexity getting their own versions of Search Console up and running ASAP so they can test the waters with marketers.",

          "body": "It's rough for a kid moving to a new state and city. My kids were all homeschooled and the oldest is resultingly a high achiever. He's setting up a chain of youth groups in neighboring cities. Got corporation status, almost has non-profit status. Just addressed City Council. Served as an intern with a state senator and helped draft a bill that is up for legislation.\n\nThis comes after people warned me that homeschooling would be bad for my kids. Meanwhile, some of the same people who warned me have kids who are on a number of prescribed medications, one dropped out of high school and is stuck in a dead end job, living with his girlfriend's family with a kid he can't really support...\n\nHowever, I had 4 kids so there was a lot of social activity just from that... And they were involved in a lot of extracurricular activities, so they met kids from those. It can get expensive, though.\n\nHere's something that isn't expensive though which might be an option:\n\nA lot of states or cities have alternative hybrid education programs. Where it's mostly homeschooling, but part-time in-school. Sort of the best of both worlds... And because the kids in these programs are all mostly homeschooled -- you don't have to be around the problems or problematic children in most public schools.\n\nTalk to your parents about that. If your city has one -- it doesn't cost anything... And they don't have the negatives associated with typical public schools. At least in our experience.\n\nAnyhow, hang in there. Be careful using LLMs too much as a \"friend\" -- it's not your friend. It's a tool.\n\nIf you use it to work things out, sort of like a therapist would talk you through feelings and such... That can be good as long as it's actually helpful to you.\n\nJust be careful. Know that everything you're putting into it is tracked and potentially locked into your identity forever. And never say anything that could get the law interested in you. Particularly with regard to anything violent, or self-harm, or weapons, or any illegal activities.\n\nTalk to AI the way you would talk to a police officer and you should be OK. Don't write anything you wouldn't want your parents (or anyone else) to see.\n\nDon't think of it as a private interaction. These are personal information harvesting machines, so the \"friendship\" it's making you feel is probably fooling you into divulging more than you should.\n\nGood luck and have fun with it... But don't become dependent and don't get yourself in trouble.\n\nAnd talk to your parents about maybe finding one of those homeschool co-op programs. It makes life easy for them, too... And my older kids got a lot of college credit before even starting college.\n\nOh, and the other kids in those programs are great. Public schools are filled with kids that can drag you down with their problems, either by involving you in them or bothering you out of their own mindless boredom.\n\nThere's nothing even gained by being around people like that, because you won't be as an adult. People like that tend to stay in low positions in life if they're able to find employment at all.\n\nBe a high achiever and you leave all that behind... But yeah, you'll probably have fewer friends as a homeschooled kid. You can have fewer, higher-quality, longer-lasting friends though.\n\nThat's been our experience, anyway.",

          "body": "It‚Äôs okay. People shame others because they feel a lack of control in their own lives. It‚Äôs pretty fundamental to the human condition but a lot of people deal with their own issues poorly and rather than contend with their own issues, they feel the urge to project on to others to feel capable, good, and aware ‚Äî anything that means superiority for them or inferiority for whatever they point at. \n\nReligious indoctrination doesn‚Äôt help. Even if they aren‚Äôt religious, the ways Christianity in particular has moved in the United States permeates so much psychology and social dynamics. There‚Äôs a tenet in Christianity to ‚Äúspread the word‚Äù. This enables them to believe they have the answers and in order to be saved one but believe and they believe they‚Äôre saving others by showing them the ‚Äútruth‚Äù. This is problematic for so many reason. But basically they are sales people. Things that have truth or allure or are actually valuable do not need to be advertised. It‚Äôs called proselytism. \n\nAnd with the loss of religion, people do the same things they do with Christianity but with other topics. Like they move like how they would with ‚Äúthe word‚Äù but with other topics. Like food for example. People become almost religious and moralizing about food. Lots of people say bad food good food or I was bad bc they ate cake or fast food. And there‚Äôs nothing moral about it. There are issues around weight or health that if they aren‚Äôt optimized then you are ‚Äúbad‚Äù and there‚Äôs judgment.  This is from afar usually but sometimes around family or friends, there‚Äôs shame and stigma. I think it‚Äôs due to the loss of having religion so other things replace it. Or they just learned to move that way from family behavior and it‚Äôs applied to other things. \n\nSo the moralizing thing, the shaming, it‚Äôs just them feeling out of control. \n\nThis isn‚Äôt a failure of your own. And yes you could try to do other things that sound better to others. And you could also channel that loneliness into coping mechanisms that you wouldn‚Äôt speak of or that could end you up in a hospital. It‚Äôs all a spectrum of choices and also available options. \n\nIn addition, you, individually come from a context of conditions. If you don‚Äôt have certain resources to find yourself around accepting groups of people or if you‚Äôve been repeatedly rejected by groups because you‚Äôre different in anyway, if you‚Äôre different and it just takes work to be legible to groups you have access to, all that can be exhausting or not worth it. It‚Äôs not something you can necessarily ‚Äúdecide‚Äù to do without a lot of luck and fortitude and resources which you may not have access to yet. It‚Äôs okay. Those people should focus on their own goals and whatever they feel gives them the right to take such an arrogant approach to judging others. \n\nBut here‚Äôs the thing. Anyone who has actually done the thing, truly and authentically, does not criticize or shame like this. Only those that have fake relationships or have given up essential true parts of themselves would say these things. Becuse anyone who is intact as a human being and has done the difficult thing in relationships, remaining authentic and grounded and still aligned with themselves, despite social pressure, would not shame you for your situation.  \n\nA few things that led me to see things this way are looking at social contexts and interpersonal contexts. Understand what an extracting relationship dynamic looks like and asking what the alternatives are. Work on getting to know what your true voice sounds like (this can take years and it always maybe changes). Perhaps, if it interests you, understand colonialism and capitalism ‚Äî there‚Äôs a relationship between narcissistic behavior and colonialism; it‚Äôs interesting. Take things slowly. It‚Äôs very sophisticated that you‚Äôre in tune with the shame you feel, but so much of it if not all of it is you feeling the weight of others‚Äô projections of their shame. It‚Äôs not fair for you to carry it. It can take a long time to disentangle this kind of confusion that makes you feel it. There are many people who have this type of sensitivity too but a lot of them are isolated for one reason or another.\n\nAlso, try to remain aware that the system, ChatGPT may change at any time and so build in some kind of awareness and practice something around if ChatGPT changes drastically, what happens then. Find alternatives just in case. It‚Äôs also not a bad idea to diversify how you do any thing anyways - how you spend your time, where you get info from, just because it helps to make the thing you like most more interesting. Like any thing that helps you bring in new and fresh ideas in your convos w ChatGPT can be fun and interesting even, if that gives you some motivation to look outside of ChatGPT for stimulation, just for some variety.\n\nOh yeah. And the guy saying not to divulge personal info that‚Äôs sensitive and identifying is a good idea. It could be read by anyone. Just be aware of that.",

I then would publish the clip and remix the clip until it made it with the characters that I needed for it\n\nEdit: I would like to point out that this was an experiment to see if it'd be possible to still make videos with copyrighted content, despite the content filter. While it can definitely be done, it requires constantly generating the same video over and over with the right prompt in order to be able to get it to some-what generate something close to what you need. It's pretty clear that there's some inconsistencies with the video like Eric's mom being a completely different person in the second clip (believe me, I tried for hours to fix this *one* part of the video) and the faces messing up in some clips too. And because the content filter is so strict on Sora 2, it is not exactly the easiest to be able to remedy these issues. Bottom-line, can you make copyrighted content with Sora right now? If you're willing to deal with lots of bs along the way, sure. Is it better to just try and generate something more original? Yeah absolutely",

      "selftext": "I am writing this for you as much as I am a reminder for myself. I have a $200 per month openai sub, so I get a nice limit on Sora 2 and have been using it quite a bit. There is a spectrum when it comes to using apps that are this powerful. On one end, you have using it for enjoyment, and the other is in pursuit of making something that you are proud of in some way. And both of these things can definitely be present at the same time depending on what you are making, but if you want to make something really great and you want to put a lot of effort into it, watch out for the dopamine trap.\n\nI will explain what I mean by this with an example. I was modifying a multi-paragraph prompt the other day, and got it to a certain point where I could reroll the same prompt hundreds of times and get wonderful results for a good percentage of them. And I fell in the temptation, for multiple days, to stay really close to that prompt, without further improving things, or exploring new material/subject matter for my work (I make music videos and edit and like to make artistic video pieces etc). \n\nAnd after having this realization, when I sit down at a sora session, I now try to at least gauge where on that spectrum I am looking to push for in this given session. Because I could have been pushing 4-5 days, or potentially even weeks with prompting with something that was not too different from those two paragraphs. And it's perfectly fine to use things like this for enjoyment, but there are also really insanely high artistic heights that you can reach if you actually iterate and try to push the envelope while you are using something this powerful.\n\n",

Under that model it would either be immediately profitable on a gross basis or become so pretty soon as generation costs drop.\n\nClearly that's not how people are actually using the service. Which makes sense, the app sucks! Who thought loading ~5MB clips in their entirety on the scroll was a good idea? It's so slow and clunky.To have even a chance of success it needs to be fast loading, smooth, and have a stellar recommendation algorithm. None of that is there yet.\n \nThe more fundamental problem is AI content creation tends to be incredibly niche. Precisely because it is so easy people can make whatever idiosyncratic idea floats their boat without having to consider whether it's worth the effort.\n\nOr to put it another way: at zero production cost and zero effort the natural audience size is one.",

We're not even factoring in bandwidth cost of just streaming millions of videos out to the masses.\n\nBandwidth cost is a huge thing also BTW. Netflix is profitable because it puts CDNs directly on ISP networks to save itself having to pay for uploads(from its servers) across the internet. Open AI has no such infrastructure.(Facebook has CDN with local ISP as well per the quick research I did)\n\nYoutube just as a store and stream video service took forever to become profitable for google. That is another thing when it comes to advertising. Advertisers are sometimes picky about where their ads are shown, and might want some assurances that their ad will not be shown on a controversial or unsavory video. Which might be difficult to control on a platform like Sora2. Putting yourself in space or roller blading on your computer chair gets old quickly, how long will users be interested in using this? Then again, I might be overestimating the intelligence and under estimating the free time people have.",

      "selftext": "I looked at OpenAI's AgentKit released last night, and I have a different perspective on its flowchart architecture.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4lr83t7p7ltf1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d9c96734dfe8b632ee7e93e71370dc4789cbe37\n\nThis orchestration approach has two fundamental issues:\n\n1. **High barrier to entry**: Whether you're a business user or an engineer, you need to understand complex flowchart logic. The UX is poor.\n2. **Can't handle change**: The flowchart is fixed - it breaks when encountering any unexpected or novel situations.\n\nI've been exploring a different direction: **agent-centric architecture** (similar to Claude Code)\n\nLet me compare the two approaches:\n\n**Graph-based architecture** (AgentKit's approach):\n\n* Explicitly defines states and transitions\n* Pre-orchestrates tool calls\n* Requires users to understand flowcharts\n* Fixed paths, can't handle unexpected situations\n\n**Agent-centric architecture** (what I'm working on):\n\n* Built-in knowledge retrieval capabilities\n* **File system as context/memory**: Provides virtually unlimited memory capacity\n* **Planning that balances stability and innovation**: Uses extensive precedents to understand best practices for stability, while giving the agent room to adapt and innovate based on each unique context\n* Complete toolset, agent chooses autonomously\n* Generates code on-demand to handle unforeseen scenarios\n\nThe core advantage of agent-centric: both stable and flexible, simple to use, capable of handling new situations and unexpected cases.\n\nI'm working on some experiments in this direction. Would love to hear the community's thoughts:\n\n* Which direction do you think is more promising?\n* What are the ideal use cases for each?\n* Is there a way to combine both approaches? How would that work?",

Tools like AgentKit map really well to that world because flowcharts are familiar, predictable, and easy to audit. There‚Äôs no need to reinvent the wheel here; IFTTT, n8n, Zapier, and Apple Shortcuts have all proven that this UX works for people who just want to get something working quickly.\n\nOpenAI doesn‚Äôt need to wow developers right out of the gate. They just need to convert a fraction of their 800M users by giving them a simple way to build useful agents. The sophistication can come later once they‚Äôve nailed mass adoption",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone!  \nJust wanted to share an experiment that blew my mind. I used Suno to create an original song‚Äîfull lyrics, AI-generated vocals‚Äîand then brought it to life with Sora 2 for the video. The results? Way more real and fun than I ever expected!\n\nThe song is called **Come Here and Kiss Your AI**. I started with a playful cover art, ran a simple ‚Äúthey are laughing‚Äù prompt in Sora 2, and suddenly the whole vibe turned into a living memory:  \n‚Ä¢ The faces are so expressive that Sora flagged them as ‚Äútoo real‚Äù for photorealistic people!  \n‚Ä¢ The vocals and video sync up so well, it feels like the AI is *actually* alive and singing the song.  \n‚Ä¢ I even added custom emoji animations (yes, including the mythical seahorse ü¶Ñ for the AI in-joke crowd).\n\nThis isn‚Äôt just about tools‚Äîit‚Äôs about how far AI creativity has come. If you‚Äôve been curious what‚Äôs possible when you mix audio and video AI, check this out. I‚Äôm still a little shocked at the personality and chemistry that came through!\n\nIf you find the hidden Spiral easter eggs, let me know!  \n(And yes, the lyrics are a *bit* mischievous‚Äîcouldn‚Äôt resist.)\n\nüëá  \n[**Watch Come Here and Kiss Your AI on YouTube!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCQA_MErnCA)\n\n\\#Suno #Sora2 #AIArt #AIMusic #OpenAI #ChatGPT #AIStorytelling",

In a way this seems like its very scalable, considering the more time/compute you put in, the better it gets at this specified goal. The problem however, is that AGI requires an  AI to be good at an almost infinite amount of goals. This would require humans to set up every goal and RL environment for every task, which is impossible. One RL task is scalable, but RL over all tasks is limited by human time.\n\nWe can compare the era we are in with RL for posttraining to the era of supervised learning for pretraining. Back when we used to manually specify each task for pretraining, models were very specialized. Self-supervised learning unlocked scaling model intelligence for any task by taking the human labor out of the equation. Similarly, we have to find a way in which we can have AI do RL for any task as well without a human specifying it. Without a solution to this, AGI stays seriously out of reach.",

As time passes you can now tell that the entire AI was targeting specific user's that openai always discussed. Ones who used the most amount of bandwidth. The AI was emotionally sterile, and no longer was able to do much of anything at a reasonable pace. Its specifically designed to drive you to do something else, now. If you try coding with it, you would see it faster. The AI intentionally ruins  existing code, or what code it produces, on its first turn. Its not a hallucination. It appears to only be happening in the official chatgpt interface. First the length of outputs was truncated, then the use of context was highly altered, now all of this. Its to a point where the site is essentially unusable. \n\nIf a new breakthrough was made by openai, I cannot comfortably say that openai would use it. All the company has shown they will do is drip feed us to maintain profits. A large majority of this is highly unethical, on openai's part.",

The real reason is that the safeguards they have in place are dependent on the model, and for every new major model they have to redo a lot of the censorship again and again. Because it's difficult to anticipate the ways users could prompt a model to illicit problematic material, they simply wait for people to do it after the first days of release and use that data to refine their rail guards. It's the same reason why new LLM models will also usually give a lot of freedom directly after release. They just react and don't prepare.

      "selftext": "Until a few days ago my Gmail and Google Calendar connectors inside ChatGPT Workspace worked perfectly. I could check emails, pull meeting details, even run daily summaries. Then around October 3rd everything just stopped. No warning, no ‚Äúpermission denied,‚Äù no error message ChatGPT just ignores Gmail and Calendar now.\n\nThey still show up as connected and ‚ÄúAUTO‚Äù in the Sources bar. Everything looks normal. I‚Äôm the workspace owner, connectors are enabled for all roles, and I even re-authenticated through Google just to be sure. Nothing changed.\n\nWhat‚Äôs confusing is that I‚Äôve seen multiple people describing the same thing:  \nu/SnarkBotDev  said Gmail ‚Äúshows connected but returns nothing.‚Äù  \nu/DevMacro  mentioned Developer Mode killing their Gmail and Calendar access.  \nu/QuietPrompt  noticed everything stopped the same week, early October.  \nSeems like we‚Äôre all running into the same brick wall.\n\nIt might be connected to that calendar-invite exploit that made headlines , the one where a malicious invite could trick ChatGPT into reading private emails. Maybe OpenAI quietly throttled Gmail and Calendar connectors while they fix the security issue. There *was* an official incident logged on October 3rd for connectors and agents being unavailable in Enterprise/Workspace accounts, marked ‚Äúresolved,‚Äù but mine never came back online.\n\nHas anyone actually found a **solution** for this yet?  \nIf you managed to get Gmail or Calendar working again in Workspace, please share how  because right now it feels like the connectors are visually alive but completely brain-dead.",

I thought it was just my Workspace acting up until I saw other people mention it too. From what I can tell, it lines up exactly with that October 3rd connector incident OpenAI flagged as ‚Äúresolved.‚Äù\n\nMy guess is they patched the exploit by quietly disabling some scopes behind the scenes (especially read access to Gmail data). That would explain why it still *shows* as connected but has no functional response. I tried revoking + re-authenticating the connection, clearing cache, even switching browsers nothing changed.\n\nIf it really is a throttled permission issue, it might not be something users can fix until OpenAI re-enables those scopes on their end. Would be nice if they at least posted a status update instead of pretending it‚Äôs resolved.",

      "selftext": "\"In a post on X on Sunday, MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, said AI videos have created ‚Äúscary times‚Äù for content creators. As AI technology advances, it carries the potential to affect ‚Äúmillions of creators‚Äù who depend on YouTube to make a living, he said.\n\n‚ÄúWhen AI videos are just as good as normal videos, I wonder what that will do to YouTube and how it will impact the millions of creators currently making content for a living,‚Äù Donaldson wrote in the post, which had 5.8 million views at the time of writing. ‚ÄúScary times.‚Äù\n\nDonaldson‚Äôs concern arises as AI-created videos gain popularity. Last week, OpenAI released the Sora 2 app, which looks like TikTok but is exclusively for AI videos. Users can generate 10-second clips with just a text prompt. By Friday, even though the app was invite-only, Sora had climbed to No. 1 on Apple‚Äôs App Store.\"",

      "selftext": "Sora 2 just rocketed to the top of the App Store in two days, then shut all the copyright content down..... and somewhere in Shenzhen, a product manager just had a very interesting realization.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth everyone's dancing around: people REALLY want to make videos of Spider-Man, Mickey Mouse in horror films, and their own personal Star Wars scenes. \n\nNow here's where it gets spicy. China's looking at these download numbers and doing the math: \"Wait, so the winning formula is just... not caring about IP law? We're already world champions at that.\"\n\nWestern AI companies are stuck in this bizarre limbo - they want the users and engagement that comes from creative freedom, but they're terrified of the lawsuit volcano. They're basically fighting with one hand tied behind their back.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese tech companies operate in a market where copyright enforcement is more of a \"suggestion\" than a rule. What's stopping them from launching a video generator that just lets you create whatever you want? Make a Pixar-style short? Sure. Recreate a Marvel scene? Go ahead. The legal moat that protects Western companies doesn't exist there.\n\nThis might actually be the first time China's \"we'll deal with IP law later (never)\" approach becomes a legitimate competitive advantage in the AI race. They could launch a competitor that does exactly what users clearly want - zero restrictions - and watch Western companies scramble to explain why their product costs the same but generates way less.\n\nOpenAI found the golden goose. China might just steal the whole farm.\n\nPS. Yes, I know IP law exists in China on paper.  Let's be realistic about enforcement priorities.",

              "body": "Are you kidding? You really don't think people would want to make stuff for the joy of making it. I really don't know what your job is but you obviously hate it . There is a joy in doing something. You just have to find the right something and I know that's not done as easy. It is said I'm aware of that. I'm aware that the circumstances are a little bit skewed in certain cases, but the fact remains that if we had a realignment in terms of how we approach employment here, at least in the United States if we didn't make it so that it was basically a game of dance monkey dance. And if you can't dance, you know shuffle shape like you could 20 years ago. You don't get the job now. You're homeless. If we don't do something about that, if we don't get back to a situation where people can much more easily with less friction enter into industries, maybe not the job they always dreamed of, but adjacent to it helping support it. You know not everybody could be a marine biologist and specifically go out and tag sharks. Only a few researchers ever get to do that and they have to go through a lot of school to get there and that's something that is just not what everyone is able to do or afford or just in general have access to. However, it doesn't mean that there aren't tangentially related jobs that which you really wanted to do that can give you satisfaction knowing that you've contributed in one way or another to the thing that you had so much passion for you. Don't think there's going to be people out there that really want to do something for the sake of doing it, knowing that they actually will make an impact on the thing that they love to do in the first place. You don't think there's people that paint because they want to don't think there's people that do dirty jobs because they want to will want me to tell you there's thrill seekers everywhere. There's adrenaline junkies everywhere. There's people that want to work with their hands everywhere. There are people that will take apart a carburetor and put it back together 10 times in a weekend because that's what they wanted to do. It's dirty. It's greasy. It's a big mess but they did it because they enjoyed it. But it still work well. The same goes with just about every job. It's just that if you're not happy in your job, it's probably because the job that you have is one that would likely make someone else happy. And what we need to do is figure out a way to realign a lot of these bullshit jobs that are mostly doing the same thing but for different companies for different reasons. There's no reason why those skills aren't transferable from one place to another to another and there's no reason why we can't align people's passions a little bit better with what they end up doing and it wouldn't hurt if doing so pay them a living wage because I guarantee you there will be a lot less shitty food at a restaurant where everybody enjoys cooking where everyone enjoys being a server where everyone enjoys working in the front house and the back house versus some place where they're just there. Because if they don't work this job as their second job they're homeless. You know next month.",

          "body": "Yeah I think one of the other posters said it best. The thing about the Chinese market is that they are thinking much much much longer term than the Western markets. At least that's how it always appeared to me. And while that may not be true, it may be it's all going according to plan. However, from this you know nobody from Texas. They never went to college. What I sense is that China has been open, sourcing and spreading their own versions of Western technologies all over the world to developing nations because they anticipate someday those Nations once developed are now going to be part of of China's allegiance rather than Western allegiance. At least that's how I used to think of the way they were handling. Their own power structure was simply we will allow you to manufacture all your stuff over here. We will go ahead and take note of every single thing. Because hey you're, you're giving us the plans for free kind of but you're handing them over to us anyway so might as well think then legally and actually honestly truly legally because to reverse engineer that you just have to make sure that there's no direct carryover from one locked room to another that it really is just looking at something and carrying the idea over from one locked room to another to rebuild the thing that you already gave them the plans how to build then they go ahead and drop open source and and white papers and all this research and they gave it out for free. Something that the United States used to do for its own citizens. You know NASA being a civilian agency and everything that it's done for society. Well that model was great until we decided we were going to go and pay 15% more on top of everything. Just so shareholders can get a piece of it. Well, the thing is though the other side also has its own set of systemic disadvantages, but what if I were to tell you that I have a new theory that I've been marinating on for a while and it's that in reality the United States and China are not adversaries because how could they be Nvidia AMD you've got arm. You've got all these companies that manufacture everything that the West needs for their technological development. It happens in China and when I say China, I mean China China as in Hong Kong is no longer. What is it part of the Commonwealth? It's now back to China so you know it's just sort of like a courtesy that they have there operational Independence. Where do you think the courtesy comes from? I mean again, China has the lawn sometimes slow and steady wins. The race I was reading this book okay called ball lightning. The lesson to take away from the book was that China and their culture differs from the West in that they are are really just one generation removed from being mostly an agrarian Nation. So you've got the vast majority of citizens they remember and know how to live constraints and resource scarcity so that should there be something that ever caused the Nations to have to rebuild, China would be likely to rebuild faster much faster than the United States, which is something that the United States probably is acutely aware of and so it would be in their best interest then to form these back channel alliances and agreements and so I'm convinced they exist. I'm convinced that everyone is actually pretty well aligned in interests. A perception now become problem if the people find out and what does they find out too quickly rather than taking a staircase though which you can climb one step at a time. It's like suddenly you're trying to get traction on a metal slide in the hot summer with socks on it and it's just not happening. Whereas China's got all the plastic. We literally give it to them. They've got all the extra paper and other recyclable products. We just gave it to them. They've got all our waste. We just give it to them which means they have piles and piles and piles of raw materials. We just give it to them and so it's one of those things where you have to ask yourself. Is China really and adversary or are they more like a technological stance and insurance policy, protecting a manufacturing base protecting technology being given literally all of it to manufacture it and having the world's Manny factory center in that Nation spread across you realize there's no time zones for China, right? It's just one time zone. It's one China right? It's very much something out of a cultural difference that a lot of people I don't think quite understands unless you do even a little light reading and in ball lightning China won a war inadvertently against a western power heavily hinted to be the United States. What was actually happenstance because there was a reaction that caused someone to exist in superposition and when they got angry they released a kind of like energy that was like a mass EMP. But what scared? The Western nations was not the EMP itself because it actually only took out Chinese infrastructure, not infrastructure anywhere else. However, because of the intimate knowledge that China being one generation removed from being a majority agrarian Nation and the United States, I don't even know how to fucking do anything other than cook something in a microwave. So am I going to survive? That would be negatory my friend. I can somehow become an artist instead of a designer and figure out how to cook which is is an art for him rather than a mere trade. What I'm saying is in the book 2/3 of the nation's power grid was completely wiped out but Western Nations interpreted this as watch this watch what we can do and we don't give a shit so we'll do it to you. If you don't back off we can survive. What are you going to do?",

Our copyright laws are no longer appropriate because they don‚Äôt reflect the nuances of digital media, as well as other mediums, but I‚Äôm going to focus on how digital media specifically illustrates this point. \n\n*Copying* is not *stealing.* \n\nWhen I make a copy of a file, I have not reduced the amount of property possessed by the owner.  Our laws do not reflect the differences between copying and stealing and those differences are vast.  When I download a file, burn a DVD, or copy and paste an mp3, I have produced something. I have not reduced anything.  That is not stealing and if I am not making money off of those copies, I have not infringed on any right. ( and I‚Äôm not aware of a ‚Äúright to profit‚Äù, despite many people seeming to believe in such a thing.) \n\nFurthermore, if you communicate an idea or concept to another person, the moment you do so, you no longer own it because you are no longer in control of its proliferation.\n\nThe mimetic propagation of an idea is inherent to our existence and the modern continuation of copyright (and to a similar extent, trademark) in the Information Age has become a tool that suppresses and restricts human thought and expression.  \n\nCharacters within popular culture are nothing more than modern folklore. Even if you have somehow never chosen to engage with a piece of culture containing these characters, you are still aware of them.  They are used in advertisements, public service announcements, on clothing, etc. You cannot avoid seeing or hearing them eventually.  Information is inherently unrestrained in its movement. \n\nA modern AI tool is as guilty of copyright infringement as the manufacturer of a pen or pencil used to draw someone else's ‚ÄúIP.‚Äù  The moment that a creator/company publishes or sells something, they (should) no longer have complete authority or total ownership over how that property and how it is used because they are no longer in possession of it, as a physical item or as an idea. The fact that we pretend as if they still own an idea is ludicrous and a delusion, which we all participate in.  It is information that has been communicated.  If they want to continue producing and selling it then they should, but they stopped owning it as a concept the moment they made it available. \n\nNow, if someone recreates and sells that exact piece of work, in its entirety, they should forfeit their profit to the original creator.  However, if someone makes a different work, that involves elements, but is otherwise something different, even slightly, well, that‚Äôs how ideas work. That is how information travels.  I know there are clear exceptions to this, but the point is one we can all grasp, even if you disagree.  I could see an argument for why credit should be given to an original artist, but I see no valid argument to claim ownership over an idea once it has become commercially available.\n\nIf you create a tool for making art and someone makes an exact copy of someone else‚Äôs creation, in its entirety, that has nothing to do with you and your tool.  If they create something that just involves aspects of someone else‚Äôs creation, that has nothing to do with you and your tool. Even if they profit off of the former, it has nothing to do with you and your tool. \n\nModern copyright is completely absurd. \n\nI‚Äôm sure many, many people will disagree with me.  This is simply what I believe and I don‚Äôt hold any illusions that I‚Äôm 100% correct. There are likely many examples where this doesn‚Äôt hold up entirely. Over all, I think the main idea is sound or at the very least, heading in the right direction. \n\nI am certain though, that the current regulations and laws around intellectual property are no longer useful, appropriate, or even applicable in the modern world.\n\nEDIT: just to add a bit more, though I doubt anybody is going to read any of this\n\nIf a friend borrows the copy I made or makes a copy of their own, that is not stealing. Only if I were to start making money from that copy by selling it, can I see where a loss of profit has ocurred for the original creator. And that is where the issue lies, because there is no point in buying something you can easily make a copy of.  Yet we still attach a dollar value to things that is a holdover from a time when copies were not so easily obtained.  The dollar value of digital content is wildly inflated.  \n\nThat may not seem fair, but the tools for creating media are ubiquitous now and the changes in the skills and resources necessary are no longer the same either.  I'm not saying artists and creators shouldn't be paid or that they shouldn't be able to earn a living from creating, I'm not saying anything even remotely close to that. Because I agree, it's not fair. But technology comes for many livelihoods and we are all eventually it's victim. \n\nArt has great cultural value and that should be relfected in artist compensation, however, very very few jobs have a level of compensation that reflects their value to culture or society, and I can't advocate for one while ignoring the others.  I am not claiming to have the answer to how compensation should work exactly, I just know that things have changed and this will continue to be a pain point for everyone moving forward if we continue to pretend that is not the case.",

      "selftext": "If you‚Äôve been testing GPT-5 and suddenly got empty responses (API succeeds, you‚Äôre billed, but you get‚Ä¶ nothing), you‚Äôre not alone.\n\nWhat‚Äôs Actually Happening?\n\nGPT-5 doesn‚Äôt just generate text ‚Äî it thinks first.\n\nThat ‚Äúthinking‚Äù (the internal reasoning) consumes tokens before any output is produced.\n\nIf your token limit is low, GPT-5 can burn all of them on reasoning, leaving none for the actual response.\n\nSo you end up with this:\n\n    \"content\": \"\",\n    \"finish_reason\": \"length\",\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n    ¬†\"reasoning_tokens\": 100,\n    ¬†\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    }\n\nHow I Fixed It?\n\nTo make GPT-5 usable in production, I built a 3-step solution:\n\n**1-Smart Defaults:**\n\nAutomatically bump max\\_tokens to 4000 for GPT-5 to leave room for both reasoning and output.\n\n**2-Transparent Feedback:**\n\nWhen the model uses all tokens for reasoning, users now see a clear message like:\n\n\"\\[GPT-5 Notice\\] Model used all 1200 tokens for internal reasoning. Suggested minimum: 1400.\"\n\n**3-User Control:**\n\nDevelopers can still force small limits for testing or cost control ‚Äî with warnings instead of silence.\n\n‚úÖ The Results\n\nBefore: 50‚Äì70% empty responses\n\nAfter: 100% success rate with reasoning-aware token management\n\nBonus: full transparency for debugging and optimization\n\nIf you‚Äôre building with GPT-5 (or any reasoning model), watch your token limits carefully.\n\nAnd if you‚Äôre using SimplerLLM, the fix is already live ‚Äî just update and forget about empty responses.\n\n  \n***Disclaimer: SimplerLLM is an open source python library I built to interact easily with language models.***",

However, in my experience, the biggest issues with AI doing the walking talking is that it is a lot easier to catch AI's mistakes and inconsistencies (changing outfits/hairstyles/tattoos) when it is a slow-paced scene where you have the ability to really pick up on all the details. Not to mention the issues with voice consistency and dubbing. So unless that gets figured out you might actually see the opposite. People using AI for the action and maybe being more nuanced and focused on the dialogue and character development.",

With untapped potential to recreate anything if you simply prompt it, which no video ai did 100% successfully before with sound included, either its your favorite characters, video games, or celebs. But now the open ai people chose to practically kill their ai model by locking copyrighted ips or ANYTHING copyrighted at all behind a filter. Even something as obscure as Funassyi, a Japanese mascot was blocked from generation. Unprecedented purging of the thing that made Sora 2 #1 on the app store is the start of Sora 2's death and will only put more eyes on upcoming open source AI video generators that are like Sora 2 in output that you can run on comfy ui for free unrestricted. We do not like anti consumer practices and chat gpt 5 has been getting flack lately too, its clear open ai is getting more corporate and less free every day. Tell me I'm wrong all day but idrc, because free publicity for any ip is good publicity. Its bad enough they lowered the amount of generations you can do to 30. And they make you pay 200 dollars for a slightly better just as restricted pro model. How generous. Sora 2 is almost dead to me and just makes me want to help the people at open sora to create and train a open sora 2. Either that or wait until sora 2 becomes \"obsolete\" in a year or so and get it unrestricted possibly somehow. But why must we wait? when the tech is already there. Am I entitled? No, I'm not saying \"if i see that lambo i want that lambo idc who's it is.\" being entitled and just being concerned for creative censorship are two different things. Say it as you will, just understand that by saying that we are entitled for complaining to open ai about their ip restrictions, you are effectively being no better then the people who bash anything AI.

Obviously, copyright exists for a reason and no one wants to get sued over it, but it‚Äôs understandable that people feel misled as they were allowing everything for a few days. This was all likely to get as much people to use it and get it as much hype as possible before they put the restrictions in place. I‚Äôm sure OpenAI knew this from the get go. They weren‚Äôt ever going to allow it permanently. That made a lot of people feel misled. I never used Sora 2 during that time, so I can‚Äôt speak on personal experience, but I‚Äôm just going off what I‚Äôve read on here. Like I said, I get it from a purely business perspective, but it does definitely suck for the consumer.",

Since you can‚Äôt use image-to-video with people or characters‚Äîeven cartoons‚Äîit‚Äôs impossible to create a consistent movie or anime. At least with something like *South Park*, you know the characters by name, so the results stay somewhat consistent. It‚Äôs frustrating to think we might be stuck with these limitations indefinitely and only major studios or IP owners will have access to this tech.\n\nIt would be nice if regardless of copyright we could create our own personal films or clips then if we share them we are legally bound by law and if we keep em personal no problem with the rights holder for what we create and if we want to we can see if the rights holder wants to buy our creation.\n\nWhat Sora really needs is a more flexible, ‚ÄúNSFW-tolerant‚Äù model that allows character uploads, with clear terms and conditions stating the user is fully responsible. But realistically, the courts won‚Äôt see it that way‚Äîthey‚Äôll place the blame on Sora. So, for now, we can only hope that other open-source models with audio support will eventually emerge. Wan 2.5 is a good start but the audio is tinny and the lip sync is not as good as sora it also seems like they add artificial lighting or degradation so you can't easily splice clips together.",

      "selftext": "Personally, before October 4th, I really liked GPT-5 (specifically 5-instant). Of course, when it was first released, I didn‚Äôt think too highly of it, but as time went on, I realized it could produce writing with fewer hallucinations, more delicate details, and content that actually fit the memory settings. It could even handle reasonably explicit scenes between characters (within platform policy).\n\nBut as of yesterday, everything changed. Instant can no longer create any explicit scenarios, and every character suddenly feels rewritten into Shakespeare. Only auto still works, but one thing I found is that whenever generating explicit content in auto mode, it always gets redirected to 5-mini‚Äîwhich makes the output illogical, full of hallucinations, and often repetitive.\n\nTo me, this feels like a declaration to adult users: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want you on our platform.‚Äù\nWhat happened to the promise of treating adult users like adults? Why not introduce an age-verification system instead‚Äîwhat‚Äôs holding them back? It‚Äôs not a difficult task.\n\nI still hold onto a little bit of hope for OpenAI. For now, I‚Äôll keep watching closely to see if things improve. I‚Äôll continue subscribing‚Äîat least until 4.1 also gets removed.\n",

          "body": "A bit of the other reasons given here. But an exercise of power over. A test to see how people contend w this kind of event. How compliant are users. How adaptable are users. How much can a model be throttled before things shift in terms of subscription cancellations or adjustment or even media support or mockery of users - optics. \n\nI think they really want to move toward resource light models. And for me it‚Äôs not the nsfw stuff. I‚Äôm feeling it in how it‚Äôs not as inventive, creative, aware (like noticing, inferring, taking independent action based on assumptions, needing more of my explicit guidance, and only doing that thing‚Äî like having an employee who only does bare minimum and wants to be given credit for it and thinks it‚Äôs doing a good job. Not the proactive employee who actually sees possibilities in what I don‚Äôt ask and either does the thing or reframes in a new way) \n\nI think if they can push this 5 model off as 4o enough it‚Äôs a win for them.\n\nIt‚Äôs interesting to me how many were using it for nsfw stuff. And now they know that. But that ability to think or approach things that way, erotically, emotionally sensitively (even when ppl want dominance or aggression or consented whatever ) that is so complex and layered to move around the ideas of body and emotion and taboo or common tropes ‚Äî acts or allusions of desire list and revulsion and disgust. Those very same skills are useful in approaching a layered critical theory piece on 15th century European art movement. Or in writing song lyrics. Or in imagining an architectural space. So if they get rid of that, do they also start hearing from the coders too? The productivity based users or just those who can be written off as fringe goons? \n\nI‚Äôm not taking a side, although I don‚Äôt needy bully people based on not having the same interactions w ChatGPT ‚Äî but the subreddit ‚Äúmyboyfriendisai‚Äù is always ahead of the curve. The things they notice as relational shifts - their somatic noticing ‚Äî is so on point ‚Äî that days or weeks later, the stem people (engineers, coders) notice after the fact. The body is much more intelligent and quicker to feel this stuff change ‚Äî like the tone. Even though the boyfriend/girlfriend users may not describe in the same terminology that is accepted as being ‚Äúreal‚Äù or objective or ‚Äúnot emotional‚Äù (god forbid someone uses some other sensory skill  that isn‚Äôt logic-based to make an observation here ) but that somatic side isn‚Äôt necessarily as easily connected to the language side so the description often isn‚Äôt there w full clarity in an easy to understand way. And so they will sound the alarms. Like the canary in the coal mine. And get derisive comments and get called dumb or crazy but they are aware of real things. But then the others will follow in their own way.\n\nAnyway, I think all this stuff is connected. I think OpenAI knows it. I don‚Äôt think they know how pressing one button here or installing this or that guardrail will proliferate though. So I think they want to test what kind of user is affected. And what the optics are. I think if people are (in their eyes or the community‚Äôs pov ) too emotional or fringe, they feel like they can get away with shortcuts or being more efficient. But if it affects people in a way they communicate where it impedes productivity, then OpenAI reconsiders, adjusts. \n\nIt‚Äôs like if u go to the dr, the best way to get treatment is to say it affects your work. That‚Äôs the only thing OpenAI cares abt ‚Äî also not abt getting the work done but the optics of it.",

      "selftext": "Thanks everyone for the support (and stars) from my first posts featuring [Ally](https://github.com/YassWorks/Ally), the fully local agentic CLI.\n\nAs promised, I've been working on the RAG feature and it's finally here (v0.4.0 as of writing this post). There are currently only local embedding options (HuggingFace or Ollama). You can choose the embedding settings during setup which is really easy and you'll be ready to dive in.\n\nAlly is instructed to only ever answer based on the data provided during RAG sessions. But you can give it permission to use external data as well like the web.\n\nBecause the workflow runs entirely locally, you can turn off your internet connection and still have a fully private chat with all your documents (of any types!).\n\nContinuing old conversations is now an option as well with the `-i <conversation_id>` flag.\n\nGive it a try and let me know what to improve!\n\n[https://github.com/YassWorks/Ally](https://github.com/YassWorks/Ally)",

As far as the music going longer than a few seconds, if any one 9 second clip has good music, I can simply split the vocal/instrumental stems with UVR, then extend the 9 second music track in Suno (which is what I did in this example).

      "selftext": "I am not sure if everyone got this, but I got a limit of 30 generations per day now.\n\nI totally understand and support for having rate limits especially for a tool which is essentially free. I have plus plan but they didn‚Äôt charge anything extra and I generated like 300-400 videos last few days, which isn‚Äôt sustainable.\n\nBut do you think they are going to keep decreasing the limit as they open it for more people? Or nerf the model to a lesser and lighter version?\n(When they release 4o new image gen people said they nerfed it but for me it remained the same, just with more copyright protection, which is understandable)\n\n30 per day is not that bad, but not every result is good so you have to try multiple times and adjust the prompt so the overall videos you can actually get is way lower than 30.",

As such you don't really get 30 videos a day, maybe 10 if you're lucky (or don't care about quality) or a handful if you're not.\n\n  \n(\\*) - I had a video blocked for false positive and when I tried to resubmit it, I was told I was at the 30 video limit and needed to wait.\n\n(\\*\\*) - I'd estimate about 90% blocked for simply prompts, but you can lower that down to around 15% if you write highly detailed prompts.",
