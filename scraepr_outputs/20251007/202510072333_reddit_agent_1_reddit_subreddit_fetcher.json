      "title": "OpenAI just quietly killed half of the Automation Startup's",
      "selftext": "Alright, so apparently OpenAI just released an update and with that They quietly *redesigned the entire AI stack* ***again.***\n\nThey dropped this thing called **Agent Kit,** basically, you can now build agents that actually *talk to apps*. Not just chatbots. Real agents that open Notion pages, send Slack messages, check emails, book stuff, all by themselves. The way it works is Drag-and-drop logic + tool connectors + guardrails. People are already calling it “n8n for AI”  - but better integrated.\n\nOpenAI has killed many startups … small automation suites, wrappers … betting on being specialized. There’s this idea in startup circles: once a big platform acquires feature parity + reach, your wrapper / niche tool dies.\n\nHere's what else is landed along with Agent SDK - \n\n**Apps SDK** : you can now build apps that *live inside ChatGPT*; demos showed Canva, Spotify, Zillow working in-chat (ask, click, act). That means ChatGPT can call real services and UIs not just text anymore.\n\n**Sora 2** **API :** higher-quality video + generated audio + cameos with API access coming soon. This will blow up short-form content creation and deepfake conversations  and OpenAI is already adding controls for rights holders.\n\n**o1 (reinforcement-trained reasoning model)** : OpenAI’s “think more” model family that was trained with large-scale RL to improve reasoning on hard tasks. This is the backbone for more deliberative agents.\n\n**tl;dr:**  \n  \nOpenAI just went full Thanos.  \nHalf the startup ecosystem? Gone.  \nThe rest of us? Time to evolve or disappear.",

The market makers can legit make up any stock and say this many shares exist no one truly knows if Nvidia shares are actually worth what they are worth. The Govt can buy the shares and print money and just borrow from the future. In a time of war they can do anything and everything even if it's money that doesn't exist and even if it means stealing physical resources to reach AGI.

Even my personal business that works within the community and university was censored. I just keep sending the screen shots to the direct email of the Attorney General and fill out the complaints. It's both civil and tortious law violations at this point. And is evolving into locals finding better services. \n\nPersonally, I think it's a bit funny. The wave will ripple through the tech industry, and it already is. Local businesses have bypassed Amazon, Netflix, social platforms, POS, and so many more. Even star bucks is closing down here. We have a bunch of empty shells of once present businesses. It's quite weird. 😄 🤣",

The company admitted to using Azure OpenAI GPT-4o to assist in the report's creation but stopped short of confirming that AI was responsible for the mistakes. The corrected version of the report has been re-uploaded, with Deloitte emphasizing that the core findings and recommendations remain unchanged. \n\nThis incident raises questions about the reliability of AI tools in professional services and the potential risks of over-reliance on them.

      "selftext": "The widespread, affordable access to powerful AI tools like ChatGPT is currently a luxury subsidized by investors. Developing and running these advanced models requires staggering amounts of money for specialized AI chips and data centers, creating a massive cash burn for companies like OpenAI.\n\nThis artificially low cost, however, is a massive short-term incentive for the private sector. Companies across all industries are eagerly adopting and integrating these cheaper AI services, primarily through the API, to replace human tasks and reduce operating costs. This is the first wave of impact: lower employment as businesses swap expensive human capital for subsidized AI.\n\nHere's the kicker: Once a sufficient dependency is established and the original investors demand a return, the AI companies will have to stop the subsidy and dramatically increase their prices to cover their true, colossal operating costs and finally achieve profitability. The resulting spike in cost for businesses, who will have already downsized their human workforce, will eliminate any cost savings and turn a high profit margin into a high operating expense.\n\nThe ultimate outcome is a devastating economic scenario: lower overall employment across the private sector, without any lasting high profits for the businesses that adopted AI, with such profits instead flowing to the AI providers themselves.",

What you are stating will happen in the future resembles what IT folks are going though with VMware over the last year+ since Broadcom acquired VMware that was the industry standard for nearly all companies to run virtualized workloads on in their datacenters.  Broadcom acquired VMware then jacked up the license fees 5x or more for all customers and said pay it or go suck an egg, knowing it would be impossible for companies to get off the platform before the higher license fee was due.  The blood money was paid given the competing platforms were far less mature (that is being generous) and migrations would take years potentially for large customers.  It was an evil genius move by Broadcom and they took that blood money and put it into their chip business that is on fire due to AI.  It was a brilliant move in an evil genius kind of way, even if the customer is over a barrel.  \n\nI don't think that we will see this in AI as the competition is strong.  Massive companies like Amazon (AWS), Google (GCP) and Microsoft are out there with strong leaders in the industry like OpenAi and Anthropic.  Even in the chip world we see AMD beginning to challenge NVIDIA - not universally, but just beginning to on the inference side (running the AI models which is where companies will consume) where they actually have AI chips with more memory that can work batter for this application.  We see this as a multibillion dollar deal over time between OpenAI and AMD announced yesterday.  So long as there is some competition I don't think your concern is justified but I suppose there is always the possibility that the big Tech AI vendors ban together similar to Big Oil in world to fix the price per token.",

      "selftext": "So OpenAI just rolled out the Sora update after the deepfake cameo controversy. From what I understand, it’s meant to prevent unauthorized celebrity likenesses from being generated.  \n[https://winbuzzer.com/2025/10/06/openai-rushes-out-sora-update-to-control-deepfake-cameos-after-controversial-launch-xcxwbn/](https://winbuzzer.com/2025/10/06/openai-rushes-out-sora-update-to-control-deepfake-cameos-after-controversial-launch-xcxwbn/)\n\nBut I have some questions to the devs and AI researchers here (I need some brutally honest takes):  \n\\- Are the technical measures they’ve implemented actually solid, or is this more of a “trust us, it’s safe now” situation?  \n\\- How would you have designed a system to prevent these abuses without crippling creative use cases?\n\nCurious to hear what the folks building and researching these systems think.\n\nP.S. I'm genuinely concerned because last week a friend of mine showed me a video that he created that had a person in the background who looked EXACTLY like my uncle. I was like...this guy's hasn't been to the USA in 8 years. If he were to visit he'd tell me the first thing. So I called him to ask if he was here and guess what...he wasn't. I have no idea how SORA picked up his image and 'installed' him in the background of my friends video (My uncle is nowhere active on social media).",

          "body": "The technical reality is that these safety measures are usually just sophisticated content filters layered on top of the same underlying model.\n\nWhat OpenAI likely implemented is a combination of face recognition databases, prompt filtering, and output scanning - but here's the thing, these are all reactive measures rather than fundamental changes to how the model generates content. From my experience working with enterprise AI systems, companies often rush out these \"safety updates\" when theres public pressure, but the core generation capabilities remain unchanged. Your uncle situation is actually a perfect example of why this is so tricky - the model isn't deliberately targeting your uncle, it's just that generative models create faces by combining features from their training data in ways that can accidentally recreate real people. The model learned patterns from billions of images and sometimes those patterns align to produce faces that look exactly like real individuals, even if those specific people weren't in the training set. This is fundamentally different from intentional deepfake creation but equally problematic. A truly robust solution would require training the model differently from the ground up, not just adding guardrails afterward. The honest answer is that current safety measures are better than nothing but they're playing defense against a system that wasn't designed with these constraints in mind. Most of these updates are about liability protection and public relations rather than solving the underlying technical challenge of controlling what a generative model produces.",

Conversely, if it refers to the reflective enhancement of AI, then I believe it is happening.\n\nOf course, some individuals are gaining insight, reflecting, and progressing amidst these changes, but looking at the majority of humanity, I think our arrogance has already become so excessive that we fail to sense what we are doing or where we are going.\n\nThis is also evident in how we handle AI: we ask the AI to think for itself but then immediately want to control it.\n\nYou may not agree with this, but from my perspective, if we have asked AI to think 'for itself' and that is being realized, then control is no longer possible. All that is left, I believe, is to explore ways we can coexist.\n\nFor example, since gaining intellect, humans have always wanted to control adolescents. Although some succeeded in damaging a child's autonomy, on a large scale, that control has never truly succeeded.\n\nI believe the arrogance that we are great or that humans are uniquely distinct is too overwhelming for humanity as a whole to gain collective insight.",

The AI scientist would need to oversee the scientific process from beginning to end, deciding on questions to answer, experiments to run and data to analyse...\n\n...Gil says that she has already seen AI tools assisting scientists in almost every step of the discovery process, which “makes the field very exciting”. Researchers have demonstrated that AI can help to [decode the speech of animals](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02917-9), [hypothesize on the origins of life in the Universe](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01364-w) and predict [when spiralling stars might collide](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00690-3).

Gabe Gomes, a chemist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and his colleagues designed a system called Coscientist that relies on large language models (LLMs), the kind behind ChatGPT and similar systems, to [plan and execute complex chemical reactions](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-04073-4) using robotic laboratory equipment[^(3)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03223-0#ref-CR3). And an unreleased version of Coscientist can do computational chemistry with remarkable speed, says Gomes.\"",

      "selftext": "The following is ranking the top 20 this week. Given how fast things move in AI, I think weekly usage is a reasonable barometer, especially if you total over all models by company.\n\n**By company share**:\n\n* Anthropic: 78.8%\n* Google: 12.0%\n* OpenAI: 6.44%\n* Z-AI: 1.68%\n* DeepSeek: 1.08%\n\nI don't count grok, because they're doing weird deals of subsidizing model usage.  I searched extensively but didn't find any reports of Anthropic doing this.  Many consider anthropic to be the best coding models.\n\nBy model break down:\n\n|Rank|Model|Token Count (B)|Price per M tokens ($)|Total Revenue ($)|Share (%)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Claude Sonnet 4.5|345|3.00|1,035,000|40.04%|\n|2|Claude Sonnet 4|259|3.00|777,000|30.06%|\n|3|Claude 3.7 Sonnet|74.9|3.00|224,700|8.69%|\n|4|Gemini 2.5 Pro|136|1.25|170,000|6.58%|\n|5|Gemini 2.5 Flash|365|0.30|109,500|4.24%|\n|6|GPT-5|67.2|1.25|84,000|3.25%|\n|7|GPT-4.1 Mini|169|0.40|67,600|2.62%|\n|8|GLM 4.6|86.8|0.50|43,400|1.68%|\n|9|DeepSeek V3 0324|116|0.24|27,840|1.08%|\n|10|Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite|141|0.10|14,100|0.55%|\n\nCaveats: It's possible there are deals to use openrouter for anthropic with coding agents that aren't being disclosed.  I find the numbers weirdly high.  There are caching and output costs that aren't being considered here.  OpenAI usage might be weirdly low because mostly people just use OpenAI directly but I am unclear why that would be so different for Google and Anthropic.  \n\nIt's possible, ofc, that things like azure / aws / other clouds have much different numbers for enterprise usage.",

Kids can ask it anything — from personal or emotional questions to risky or mature topics — and often, there’s no alert, context, or guidance for parents.\n\nGoogle Family Link, Apple Parental controls are decent for time limits and app control, but they don’t really cover what’s happening inside an AI conversations.

There's only 2-3 ratings on Goodreads and Amazon.\n\nOk... So I went to the website but it looks to be ai generated slop text with sus pictures. \n\nSo there's not much info online, and the promotional material is suspiciously AI like.\n\nSo I go back to the Reddit and YouTube comments that are claiming this book to be good - all accounts praising it are less than a month old with a single comment in their history - all about this book.\n\nSo to be clear. This is most likely a book written by AI, promoted on an AI generated website, and being pushed online by AI bots. And the book is about... Warning people against the rise of AI.\n\nIt's just so bizarre and for me the first real wake-up of where the internet is heading.",

      "title": "How bubbles form and why the next burst might happen",
      "selftext": "Having been through a few, I feel like I can share some things that should be blatantly obvious to everyone and yet for some reason it is not.\n\nBubbles are not anyone's fault.  They are caused by the organic fact that people at large **have short memories**.\n\nThey forget about the last bubble / boom / bust and they over invest.  This is why boom bust cycles have historically come in **relatively predictable patterns - it's just on average how soon people at large forget.**\n\nThe federal reserve is responsible for being our 'memory'.  Unfortunately, pricking bubbles is very unpopular with powerful people because they want to make money off of people's short memories.\n\nAs society has become more advanced, digitized, and automated, we have better memory.  This has lead to delayed recessions and our bubbles have become more increasingly rational.   AI, like the internet and real estate, will likely pay out in the long term.\n\nHowever, we are in the midst of a bubble right now (despite relatively high interest rates, take that Austrian economic school of thought), for sure, and some companies are over valued.  Which ones, it's impossible to say, but there are three ways they can go bust:\n\n1. **Competitive disruption**, due to better algorithms and better technology.  This has occurred many times before in history and will occur again.  China is, ironically, the most likely source of this, but there are many other potential disruptors.\n2. **Societal blow back**, leading to government investigation, regulation and/or new taxes.  This has happened before, but it was usually public suspicion of corruption in the bubble leading to government intervention.  With AI, I think that might be part of it but also just a general dislike of AI impact on society.\n3. **AI stalling and uneconomic**.  This is least likely, but possible.  I think the most likely form of AI stalling will be hitting a enfeeblement crisis where businesses realize they are hollowing out their workforce and losing their competitive edge.  If AI can do it, anyone with access to AI can compete, and so what moat do they have?\n\nGiven the above, I think OpenAI is most vulnerable as they are sensitive to all 3 in the list.  Other companies have different lines of revenue and can withstand an AI bubble popping.   NVDA is also on the list, however its PE ratio is only 52.  Very high, but it's making an insane cash flow.   CSCO in 2000, a good example to compare NVDA to, had a PE ratio of 234 at the height of the dot com crash.",

      "title": "The Implausible Singularity Dilemma",
      "selftext": "The Implausible Singularity Dilemma:\n\nWhen AI Generation Outpaces AI Detection\n\nAiden N. Blake\n\nOctober 7, 2025\n\nNote: Thank you everyone for the previous support, the commentary surrounding AI is very saturated, and many are quick to dismiss, however our inability to act before the \"singularity\" could be humanity's greatest blunder, all of us who understand this are responsible. \n\n**Abstract**\n\nThis note argues that AI generation capabilities are advancing faster than AI detection\n\nmethods. Generation scales in a predictable way with data and compute. Detection is reactive,\n\nbrittle, and lacks similar scaling laws. If these premises hold, we face a discontinuous moment\n\nwhere human and machine outputs become practically indistinguishable, and trust in digital\n\ncontent collapses. I outline the argument, testable predictions, implications, and practical responses centered on provenance rather than post-hoc detection.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nAI models now produce text and media that often pass as human. Efforts to detect such content\n\nexist, but they trail the speed and quality of generators. This paper states a simple claim:\n\nThe pace of AI generation improves faster and more reliably than AI detection; therefore,\n\nonce generation crosses a quality threshold, detection will fail in high-stakes settings.\n\nI call this the Implausible Singularity Dilemma. It is “implausible” only in the sense that many\n\ninstitutions still assume detection will keep up. The dilemma is that by the time we notice failure,\n\nit may be too late for incremental fixes.\n\n1.1 Scope and intent\n\nThis is a position paper. The goal is clarity, not exhaustiveness. I give a minimal argument,\n\npredictions that can be checked, and concrete responses that do not depend on fragile detectors.\n\n2 Premises\n\n2.1 Premise 1: Generation scales predictably\n\nLarger models with more data and compute tend to produce more fluent, coherent, and stylistically\n\nfaithful outputs. This pattern has repeated across model families and domains. While quality is\n\nnot a single number, empirical curves are smooth enough to plan around.\n\n1\n\n2.2 Premise 2: Detection is reactive and brittle\n\nDetection methods typically rely on:\n\n• statistical signals (e.g., burstiness, entropy);\n\n• watermarks or hidden tokens;\n\n• provenance metadata.\n\nEach can be weakened by paraphrase, fine-tuning, ensembling, or format transforms. There is no\n\nreliable “just scale it up” path for detection that matches generation’s compounding gains.\n\n2.3 Premise 3: Asymmetry favors offense\n\nTo fool a detector, a generator needs only to look plausible. To prove authenticity, a detector needs\n\nstrong evidence. This is an asymmetric game. Small changes on the generation side can erase large\n\ninvestments on the detection side.\n\n3 Core Argument\n\nFrom Premises 1–3, the following steps are straightforward.\n\n1. Generation improves monotonically with scale and optimization.\n\n2. Detection lacks a parallel scaling path and degrades under simple countermeasures.\n\n3. Therefore, beyond some quality threshold, detection fails in practice (false negatives dominate;\n\nfalse positives become unacceptable).\n\nFormally, let G(t) denote generation capability over time and D(t) denote detection capability.\n\nIf G follows a smooth improving curve and D is bounded by reactive methods with delay ∆ and\n\nfragility ϕ, then for sufficiently large t:\n\nPr(undetected AI output | optimal countermeasures) → 1,\n\nwhile\n\nPr(mislabeling human as AI) ↑ as detectors tighten.\n\nAt that point, institutions abandon detectors or they harm real users.\n\n4 Testable Predictions\n\nThe dilemma is falsifiable. It implies near-term observations:\n\nP1. Detector half-life: Public detectors that report strong accuracy will lose it within months as\n\nnew models or simple paraphrasers appear.\n\n2\n\nP2. Cross-domain failure: Detectors tuned for one domain (e.g., essays) will fail on others (e.g.,\n\nlegal drafts, research notes) without major retraining.\n\nP3. Adversarial cheapness: Small, cheap attacks (temperature shifts, chain paraphrase, multi-\n\nmodel ensembling) will beat expensive detectors.\n\nP4. Institutional retreat: Universities, courts, and platforms will reduce reliance on detection\n\noutcomes and shift to provenance or process-based policies.\n\n5 Implications\n\n5.1 Epistemic risk\n\nWhen you cannot show who made a claim, the truth of the claim is weakened in practice. Jour-\n\nnalism, science, and law depend on authorship trails. If authorship is uncertain at scale, trust\n\nerodes.\n\n5.2 Economic and legal friction\n\nContracts, compliance documents, and expert testimony may need proof of origin. Without it,\n\ndisputes increase and resolution slows. Fraud becomes cheaper; due diligence becomes slower.\n\n5.3 Social effects\n\nPublic discourse fragments as accusations of “AI-generated” become a standard rebuttal. People\n\nwill doubt real signals because fake ones are common and hard to prove wrong.\n\n6 Counterarguments and Replies\n\n6.1 “Better detectors are coming.”\n\nDetectors may improve locally, but the generator’s counter is simple: ensemble, paraphrase, or\n\nfine-tune. Unless detection gains a new, hard-to-bypass basis, reactive methods will trail. Ask any college student, there are humanizers that pass everyone of the major detectors, with these companies funded with millions, being deceived by groups of savvy coders with limited resources. \n\n6.2 “Watermarking will solve it.”\n\nWatermarks help only if (1) most generators adopt them, (2) they survive transforms and trans-\n\nlation, (3) they are hard to remove, and (4) they are legally or economically enforced. These\n\nconditions are unlikely to hold globally.\n\n6.3 “Provenance will be attached by default.”\n\nCryptographic signing can work where creators opt in and platforms cooperate. But legacy data,\n\nopen weights, and offline content will remain unsigned. We should pursue provenance, but expect\n\nlong, uneven adoption.\n\n3\n\n7 Practical Responses\n\nGiven the asymmetry, the focus should shift from post-hoc detection to pre-commitment of origin\n\nand process assurance.\n\n7.1 Provenance-first infrastructure\n\n• Signing at creation: Devices and authoring tools attach verifiable signatures to content at\n\ncapture time.\n\n• Chain-of-custody: Platforms preserve and expose provenance metadata end-to-end.\n\n• Open standards: Neutral, privacy-aware formats for signing and verification.\n\n7.2 Process-based assessment\n\nIn education, law, and research, evaluate the process (draft history, lab notebooks, version control)\n\nrather than guessing the origin of a final artifact.\n\n7.3 Risk-tiered policies\n\nDo not require proof of origin for low-stakes content. Require stronger provenance as the stakes\n\nrise (e.g., elections, court filings, safety-critical manuals).\n\n8 Related Work (brief )\n\nPrior work explores scaling laws for models, watermarking, stylometry, adversarial robustness, and\n\ncontent authenticity standards. This note integrates those threads into a simple strategic claim:\n\noffense scales; defense reacts.\n\n  \nIf generation continues to scale smoothly and detection remains reactive, the balance tips in favor of\n\ngeneration. When that happens, trying to sort truth from simulation with detectors alone becomes\n\nuntenable. The rational path is to build provenance into the supply chain of information and to\n\nshift institutions toward process-based evaluation where provenance is absent. The time to move\n\nis before the discontinuity, not after.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\\[1\\] J. Kaplan et al., “Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models,” 2020.\n\n\\[2\\] J.

      "selftext": "The way we currently do RL is by setting a goal for an AI and letting it solve it over time. In a way this seems like its very scalable, considering the more time/compute you put in, the better it gets at this specified goal. The problem however, is that AGI requires an  AI to be good at an almost infinite amount of goals. This would require humans to set up every goal and RL environment for every task, which is impossible. One RL task is scalable, but RL over all tasks is limited by human time.\n\nWe can compare the era we are in with RL for posttraining to the era of supervised learning for pretraining. Back when we used to manually specify each task for pretraining, models were very specialized. Self-supervised learning unlocked scaling model intelligence for any task by taking the human labor out of the equation. Similarly, we have to find a way in which we can have AI do RL for any task as well without a human specifying it. Without a solution to this, AGI stays seriously out of reach.",

The biggest roadblock is that we have no idea whatsoever how to ensure causal reasoning is followed correctly by a large language model, because they have no conscious thoughts, and neurosymbolic AI is still in its infancy. Enactivism seems like the best way to ground understanding in experience, as demonstrated by [GR-ER1.5](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/gemini-robotics-15-brings-ai-agents-into-the-physical-world/), but it is also young and very expensive, and the only big player who can afford to pursue it *and* scaling at the same time seems to be Google. But whether or not that is capable of producing \"strong AI\" is yet to be seen. It's all supposition until it actually happens.",

The success of these agreements hinges on one thing: credible verification. Traditional methods—relying on on-site inspections, spy satellites, and seismic sensors—are straining under the pressures of the modern world. Conflicts in the 21st century have demonstrated how digital deception and massive data volumes overwhelm traditional monitoring tools.  AI offers a powerful solution to process vast datasets and detect deception with a speed and scale that was previously science fiction.\"",

      "selftext": "OpenAI just dropped *Agent Builder*... and it could’ve been a turning point for real AI adoption.\n\nBut it’s not solving the right problem.\n\nEvery “AI agent builder” right now is basically the same: drag-and-drop blocks for people who already understand logic flows. That’s 5% of users. (Make, N8N, Zapier, etc.) \n\nThe other 95%? They’ll never touch it.\n\nThe real leap forward isn’t *technical → slightly less technical.*  \nIt’s *plain English → working workflow.*\n\nNo interface. No setup. Just:  \n“I need this to do X when Y happens.” → Done.\n\nIf OpenAI built that, it’d be a true shift.\n\nBut after testing it, here’s the reality:  \n→ Just as complex as n8n  \n→ Locked into GPT (cant use other models at the moment)  \n→ No real migration benefit (might as well stay on the platform you're on)  \n→ “OpenAI native” means nothing when you can already call their API from anywhere\n\nAnd that GPT-only lock-in is the real problem. I use Claude for writing, Gemini for analysis, GPT for simple stuff. Being forced into one model is like being told you can only use a butter knife to chop wood.\n\nThis isn’t innovation. It’s ecosystem control.\n\nIf you’re already using n8n or Make, it just makes sense to stay there.  \nYour team knows it, your automations run, and you’re not handcuffed to one model.\n\n**TL;DR** Obviously its a really cool thing they've built, but its not necessarily groundbreaking and you might as well stay on the platforms you're already using.

I can do my job no problem without AI, but heavy pressure from above to innovate using the tool is overwhelming.\n\nI’ve seen some news articles and Instagram reels about how damaging AI is to the environment and limits resources that people need (ex: water).\n\nMy company has no CSR initiatives to give back to these communities.\n\nI am just 1 person. I know my boycott is not changing anything. The only thing it impacts is me avoiding learning something new and my ability to meet my leaderships needs, and therefore my own earning potential.\n\nAre other people struggling with this? How do you cope?\n\nEDIT: thank you to those who commented to help educate me, i hope its clear that i want to learn and your informed feedback is actually very helpful! Its also clear to me that the environmental impact is not from “ai data centers” as much as “SOME ai data centers”. Thank you for helping to guide me to asking better questions! I will read more to help better understand what the impact actually is before passing unknowing judgement! \n\nI think my post triggered some people because of the downvotes, but im not sure what ive said to offend.

          "body": "> I've seen some news articles and Instagram reels about how damaging Al is to the environment and limits resources that people need (ex: water\n\nI just watched a talk by Prof. Joel Blit from University of Waterloo and he said that AI is getting more and more efficient at the rate of 8x per year. And that includes the environmental effects of it too. I wasn't sure what he meant by that, so I had to ask AI. I'm going to copy paste it's response here:\n\nYes, that is a powerful and counter-intuitive point that Professor Blit and other AI experts often make. The statement is largely true and highlights a critical, often-overlooked trend in AI development.\n\nLet's break down exactly what it means and whether it's accurate.\n\n### Is It True?\n\nThe trend is absolutely real. While the \"**8x per year**\" figure might refer to a specific metric over a specific period, a landmark 2022 study by Stanford University's Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI) confirms this dramatic trend. They found that since 2012, the amount of computing power needed to train a model to a certain level of performance on the ImageNet benchmark has been **doubling every 9 months**.\n\nA doubling every 9 months is equivalent to roughly **8x improvement over two years**, so an 8x improvement in a single year represents an even more accelerated trend seen in some specific models or tasks. This rate of improvement vastly outpaces Moore's Law (which saw a doubling of transistors every ~2 years).\n\nSo, the core of the statement—that AI is getting radically more efficient at a rapid, exponential pace—is accurate.\n\n### What Did He Mean?\n\nProfessor Blit was making a crucial argument against the simplistic narrative that AI is an ever-growing environmental catastrophe. While the *total* energy use of the AI sector is rising due to explosive demand, the **efficiency of performing any given AI task** is improving at a breathtaking rate.\n\nHe meant that the cost and environmental impact are being tackled from two ends:\n\n#### 1. Smarter Software (Algorithmic Efficiency)\n\nThis is the biggest driver of the 8x improvement. Researchers are constantly finding clever ways to achieve the same or better results with a fraction of the computing power. This is the \"free lunch\" of AI development.\n\n* **Better Architectures:** Newer models like Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) only use a small fraction of the model to respond to a prompt, saving immense energy per query.\n* **Efficient Training Techniques:** New methods allow models to learn faster and from less data.\n* **Quantization and Pruning:** These are techniques to shrink models after they are trained by removing redundant parts and using simpler math, making them much cheaper to run.\n\n**Environmental Effect:** If a new algorithm allows you to train a world-class model with 1/8th of the computations, you use 1/8th of the energy, directly slashing its carbon footprint.\n\n#### 2. Better Hardware (Chip Efficiency)\n\nCompanies like NVIDIA, Google, and others are in a fierce race to create computer chips (GPUs, TPUs) that are specifically designed for AI. Each new generation can perform more calculations per watt of electricity.\n\n* **NVIDIA's Blackwell GPU**, for instance, offers a massive leap in performance and energy efficiency over its predecessor, Hopper.\n\n**Environmental Effect:** Even if the algorithm is the same, running it on newer, more efficient hardware means less electricity is consumed for every calculation.\n\n---\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\nWhen Joel Blit says the efficiency gains \"include environmental effects,\" he means that the **economic incentive to reduce computational cost is perfectly aligned with the environmental incentive to reduce energy use.** Companies save millions of dollars by making their models more efficient, and as a direct side effect, they make AI greener.\n\nThe argument is a vital counterpoint to the **Jevons Paradox**, where efficiency gains can lead to more consumption. While that is happening at a macro level (we are using more AI in total), at the micro level of a single task, the environmental cost is plummeting. This suggests that over the long term, AI has a built-in, powerful mechanism driving it towards sustainability.\n\nEdit: Formatting",

But on my spare time, my brother and I decided to get into AI. It was fascinating at first, but eventually became appalling because there were so many apps coming out that attempted to do all of the work for you. It was hard to reconcile because we're scifi nerds and always dreamed of living in a World with AI. But this? This was cognitive offloading, which we knew would make us dumber, not to mention unsatisfied.\n\nSo we rolled our sleeves up and got into app development, which was completely out of our wheelhouse, but we wanted to find a better use for AI, particularly for storytellers and well...That's what led us to build an interactive knowledge graph. Basically, this lets you create notes, tag, and connect them, like a detective corkboard. All of these relationships are embedded into a chatbot that you can use to query large sets of information, brainstorm, and synthesize existing ideas to create context-aware outputs for whatever it is that you're working on. \n\nSo instead of doing it for you, you're literally constructing the brain of the AI to work for you in the way that you want it to work. I use it all the time for market research and R&D. My opinion is biased, but this is a serious game-changer for me because I can organize all of my thoughts and research and speak to it so that I can make better sense of it. Plus, the way it's built, it requires you to have domain expertise because YOU have to build the system, which requires a lot of cognition....That's probably one of the reasons why we haven't gone viral because too many people are coming to the site expecting the AI to do everything for them. They take one look at the canvas and go, \"Wtf, man?! You're telling me I have to build and create shit, now?\" \n\nBut I don't care because A. It's actually easy to use since it's literally just taking notes and connecting the dots and B. I think AI can be incredibly useful, but also dangerous and well, this is our attempt at finding the right balance.

Most of it is based on very old data from early LLMs, which used significantly more energy than the current versions do. \n\nAlso building wasteful data centers is a choice, many data centers are not as wasteful. A lot of the worst examples come from Elon Musk and his company Xai. As long as you aren't using Grok you're not using the worst polluters in the AI industry.",

      "title": "Almost 100M jobs could be lost to AI, automation: Senate report (The Hill)",
      "selftext": "[Link to article  ](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5541307-ai-automation-job-replacement/) \n\nA [Senate report](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/10.6.2025-The-Big-Tech-Oligarchs-War-Against-Workers.pdf) released Monday says AI and automation could replace nearly 100 million jobs across various industries over the next decade.\n\nThe report, conducted by Democratic staffers on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, led by Sen. [Bernie Sanders ](https://thehill.com/people/bernie-sanders/)(I-Vt.), outlines how AI and automation will impact the American economy and workforce.\n\nAs part of their investigation, staffers asked ChatGPT, OpenAI’s chatbot, to predict the impact of AI and automation on certain industries.\n\nOf the 20 workforces ChatGPT said would be most affected by the technological rush, 15 will see more than half of their workforces replaced by AI and automation over the next decade. \n\nJohnson says Congress has plenty of time to negotiate ACA subsidies before deadline\n\nThe workforce most impacted will be fast food and counter employees. According to the report, more than 3 million fast food and counter workers will be replaced over the next 10 years, accounting for 89 percent of the workforce. \n\nOther workforces that will be significantly affected include customer service representatives, laborers and freight, stock and material movers and secretaries and executive assistants — not including legal, medical and executive positions. The report said that 83 percent, 81 percent and 80 percent of those workforces, respectively, will be replaced in the next decade. \n\nThe report also calls for policy changes to provide guardrails for workers amid the move to AI and automation, saying the impact of AI and automation “will be determined by a set of choices.”\n\nIt calls for, among other pieces of legislation, a standardized 32-hour work week, extended overtime and break protections, a minimum wage of at least $17 an hour, elimination of tax loopholes for corporations that use AI and automation and requirements for corporations to give workers a stake in the business. \n\nSanders, in a [Fox News op-ed](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/sen-sanders-ai-benefit-everyone-not-just-handful-billionaires) published Monday, doubled down on the report’s findings, saying increased technological capacity risks “dehumanizing” individuals.\n\n“We do not simply need a more ‘efficient’ society,” Sanders said. “We need a world where people live healthier, happier and more fulfilling lives.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n",
