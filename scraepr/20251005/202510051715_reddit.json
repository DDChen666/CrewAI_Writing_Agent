Gen. Clint Hinote says it is a revolution born of necessity: \"The Air Force was so good for so long that it didn't need to change. Now it needs to change, and it's trying to figure out how.\"\n\nChange because the Chinese air force, which recently  showcased its newest jet fighters and its own AI drone, could be more than a match for the U.S. Air Force. According to Hinote, \"If we have to fight China, we're likely doing it in their front yard, and that means they can bring many, many more things to bear than we can, because it's so far away. You're having to achieve kill ratios of 10 to 1, 15 to 1, and 20 to 1 to even stay in the game.\"\n\nI asked, \"How do these war games come out when American pilots are going up against 20 to 1 odds?\"\n\n\"The war games don't turn out very well,\" Hinote replied. \"We lose.\"\"",
